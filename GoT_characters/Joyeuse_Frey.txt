He tells her that Lord Walder is about to celebrate his 90th [[nameday]] and has taken another wife in celebration of the event. [[Tyrion Lannister]] finds this notion amusing, at least until the [[Knight of House Frey|Frey knight]] agrees to help Catelyn take Tyrion prisoner for the attempted murder of her son [[Bran Stark|Bran]].<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Walder and Joyeuse 1x09.png|thumb|Lord Walder and his new wife.]]\nArriving at the [[Twins]], Catelyn greets Lord Walder Frey and his young, 15-year-old wife, Lady Joyeuse, whom Lord Walder gropes even as he speaks. Walder dismisses his family, including Joyeuse, while he and Catelyn haggle on what price the [[House Stark|Starks]] will pay to be allowed to cross the river.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\n\nLady Joyeuse is present at the main hall of the [[Twins]] when [[Robb Stark]] presents himself to pay his respects to Lord Walder and beg his forgiveness for the breaking of their [[marriage]] pact. She remains with her husband during the wedding ceremony of [[Edmure Tully]] and [[Roslin Tully|Roslin Frey]] and sits beside him during the feast, but doesn't take part in the [[bedding]].\n\n[[File:Catelyn_kills_Joyeuse.jpeg|thumb|Lady Frey is killed by Catelyn Stark.]]\nWhen the [[Red Wedding|massacre]] of the Stark household and bannermen begins, Joyeuse, visibly scared, hides under a table while the carnage takes place. Injured, [[Catelyn Stark]] takes her hostage and threatens to kill her if Robb is not allowed to leave the Twins untouched. However, Lord Walder refuses, boasting he can get a new wife. After Robb is murdered by [[Roose Bolton]], Catelyn slits Joyeuse's throat out of frustration.<ref>\"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|9=yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances|9=yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances||||||note}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Bran's vision\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Frey family tree}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery columns=\"3\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"170\" captionalign=\"left\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nJoyeuse Erenford.jpg|Joyeuse at the Twins in \"[[Baelor]]\".\nCatelynJoyeuse3x09.jpg|Catelyn is holding a knife to Joyeuse's throat in \"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKelly Long has been a stand-in for [[Emilia Clarke]], [[Michelle Fairley]], [[Lena Headey]], and [[Sophie Turner]].

House Erenford is a minor vassal house of the [[Riverlands]], sworn to [[House Frey]]. In the books, Catelyn does not kill her during the Red Wedding, but Aegon (aka Jinglebell), Lord Frey's mentally disabled grandson (not included in the TV series). Lady Joyeuse is later mentioned to be pregnant.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Joyeuse Erenford}}\n* {{AWOIAF|Aegon Frey (son of Stevron)|Aegon Frey}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Frey navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frey, Joyeuse}}\n\n[[de:Sonnenschein Erenfurt]]\n[[es:Joyeuse Erenford]]\n[[nl:Joyeuse Erenvoort]]\n[[ru:\u0416\u043e\u0439\u0435\u0437 \u042d\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u4e54\u82cf\u73ca\u00b7\u6069\u4f5b\u5fb7]]\n[[ro:Joyeuse Frey]]\n[[fr:Joyeuse Frey]]\n[[Category:Members of House Frey]]\n[[Category:House Erenford|Joyeuse]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

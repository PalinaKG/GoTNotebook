He has only appeared in the [[House Tyrell]] family tree issued by [[HBO]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nGarlan Tyrell is the second son of [[Mace Tyrell|Mace]] and [[Alerie Tyrell]]. He has two brothers, [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]] and [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]], and one sister, [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]].<ref>http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/tyrell/</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Tyrell family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, his family remains the same. Garlan is married to Lady Leonette of [[House Fossoway]], but they do not yet have any children. He is a taller, bearded version of his brother Ser Loras Tyrell, but less handsome. He is five years older than Ser Loras. He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman, usually training against three or four swordsmen, practice for actual battle, but his lack of interest in gaining glory makes him less famous than his younger brother, Ser Loras. He is known as Garlan the Gallant and his personal coat of arms is two golden roses on green.\n\nIn the books, it is Garlan, not Loras, who rides wearing [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]'s armor during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], because the late King's armor fit Garlan better than it fit Loras. Garlan is the one who requests that Joffrey marry Margaery, while Loras asks to be a Kingsguard.\n\nGarlan dances with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at her wedding. Noticing how unhappy she is to be married against her will, he treats her very kindly and gently, and even makes her laugh by mentioning the ridiculous nicknames he was called as a child; that cheers her spirit a bit. Garlan tells her \"I have seen how you look at my brother. Loras is valiant and handsome, and we all love him dearly... but [[Tyrion Lannister|your Imp]] will make a better husband\". Garlan perhaps meant to imply by that Sansa wouldn't be happy married to Loras, even if that was possible (as a member of the [[Kingsguard]], Loras is forbidden of getting married), due to his sexual preference.\n\nGarlan is one of the only two people (the second is [[Lancel Lannister]]) who praise Tyrion for his valor in the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion is grateful to hear this.\n\nAt the [[Purple Wedding]], Garlan and his wife sit next to Tyrion and Sansa. When [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] spills wine on Tyrion, Garlan protests \"That was ill done, Your Grace\". As Joffrey collapses, Garlan is the first who rushes to help him.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Tyrell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tyrell, Garlan}}\n\n[[de:Garlan Tyrell]]\n[[es:Garlan Tyrell]]\n[[pl:Garlan Tyrell]]\n[[zh:\u52a0\u5170\u00b7\u63d0\u5229\u5c14]]\n[[ro:Garlan Tyrell]]\n[[Category:Game of Thrones cut content]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

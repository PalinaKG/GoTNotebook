He was killed by a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]] while on a ranging [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the [[Wall]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nGared is a [[ranger]] in the [[Night's Watch]]. He is an older, more experienced ranger and a capable soldier.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Waymar_Royce,_Gared_&_Will.jpg|thumb|Rangers Gared, Ser Waymar Royce and Will depart Castle Black on a ranging beyond the Wall.]]\nGared, along with [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Waymar Royce]] and [[Will]],\u00a0departs from\u00a0the Wall\u00a0to investigate reports of\u00a0[[wildlings]] in the [[Haunted Forest]] which lies\u00a0[[beyond the Wall]]. Will, the best scout in the group, goes on a different path to scout.\n\nWhen Will rejoins the group, he reports about wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Gared insists on returning to [[Castle Black]]\u00a0to report the situation to the [[Night's Watch]] but Ser Waymar is unfazed. Instead, he commands the group to go to the site to determine what killed the wildlings. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. Gared\u00a0sends Will to find the bodies.\n\nWhile Will scouts around for clues, Gared finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow. He then sees a humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes, a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]], arrives and kills Ser Waymar with ease. Gared attempts to escape but is caught and beheaded by the White Walker.<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gared is past fifty and has lost both ears, his left little finger, and three toes to frostbite. His brother died to the frostbite while he were on duty. He has been on the [[Wall]] for over forty years. Gared doesn't like his commander [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Waymar Royce]] because he flattens him. Gared has watched many insignificant [[Lordship|lords]] come and go at the Wall in his past forty years as a ranger. Gared is a veteran amongst the [[ranger]]s. He has over one hundred scouting missions beyond the [[Wall]] at the [[Haunted Forest]].\n\nSome of Gared and [[Will]]'s roles have been switched around from the books; in the book it is Gared who escapes and is [[Execution|executed]] for [[desertion]].\u00a0\n\nIn the book, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] kicks Gared's severed head and laughs. [[Jon Snow|Jon]] disapproves of that.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n[[de:Gared]]\n[[es:Gared]]\n[[fr:Gared]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u76d6\u745e]]\n[[ro:Gared (serial)]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

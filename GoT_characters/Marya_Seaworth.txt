He then found a woman, Marya, kind enough to overlook his trade.<ref name=\"Lore\">\"[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories & Lore)#Davos Seaworth's perspective|Histories & Lore: Robert's Rebellion \u2013 Davos Seaworth entry]]\"</ref> [[Salladhor Saan]] attended their wedding feast.<ref name=\":0\">\"[[Valar Dohaeris]]\"</ref> She gave him a son they named Matthos. Marya and Davos hoped that he would eventually save enough riches so he could quit smuggling.<ref name=\"Lore\" />\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nWhen Matthos suggests to his father that he learn to read, Davos is reminded of his wife also wanting to teach him how to read.<ref>\"[[The Night Lands]]\"</ref> [[Melisandre]] asks Davos if he loves his wife to which he replies he does. She asserts that he answers that way yet he has known other women and Davos tells her not to talk about his wife anymore. Melisandre says that she is speaking of other women like herself and asserts that Davos wants her.<ref>\"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nAfter rescuing Davos, Salladhor Saan advises him to return to Marya so he can comfort her following their son's death, but Davos demands to be taken to [[Dragonstone]] to stop Melisandre. Salladhor agrees but jokes that, after Davos is killed, he will gather his bones so that Marya can wear them around her neck.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Seaworth family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Marya is the daughter of a common carpenter. She has seven sons with Davos: Dale, Allard, [[Matthos Seaworth|Matthos]], Marc, Devan, Stannis (named after [[Stannis Baratheon|the king]]), and Steffon. \n\nWhile Davos goes with Stannis's household to Dragonstone, Marya remains at the family keep in Cape Wrath to raise their two youngest sons. Of Marya's other five sons, only Devan survives the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].\n\nWhile Davos is imprisoned at the [[White Harbor]], uncertain what fate has in store for him, he writes Marya a letter: ''\"I was a better smuggler than a knight, a better knight than a King's Hand, a better King's Hand than a husband. I am so sorry. Marya, I have loved you. Please forgive the wrongs I did you. Should Stannis lose his war, our lands will be lost as well. Take the boys across the narrow sea to [[Braavos]] and teach them to think kindly of me, if you would. Should Stannis gain the [[Iron Throne]], [[House Seaworth]] will survive and Devan will remain at court. He will help you place the other boys with noble lords, where they can serve as pages and squires and win their knighthoods\"''. Before leaving the cell, he asks [[Robett Glover]] to send the letter, in case he dies. Robett promises Davos he will.\n\nMarya is described as good-natured, plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Seaworth navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seaworth, Marya}}\n\n[[de:Marya Seewert]]\n[[fr:Marya Mervault]]\n[[pl:Marya Seaworth]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0421\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0442]]\n[[Category:Members of House Seaworth]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

When newly-crowned King [[Maegor Targaryen]] returned to [[King's Landing]], Ser [[Damon Morrigen]] challenged the Faith Militant to a [[Trial by combat]] to prove his right to rule. They accepted, and [[Trial by seven of Maegor Targaryen|the resulting trial of seven]] pitted Maegor and six of his [[Kingsguard]] against Ser Damon and six other champions of the Faith Militant, among whom was Ser Dickon. The tales about the resulting confrontation are many, but by the end, of the fourteen men who entered the field only Maegor was left alive.<ref>\"[[The Faith Militant]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Dickon Flowers is a member of the Warrior's Sons - one of two military orders that comprises the Faith Militant. In the TV show the Faith Militant is condensed into a single order. Ser Dickon, also known as the Bastard of Beesbury, was stationed at the [[King's Landing]] chapter of the Warrior's Sons, based in the [[Sept of Remembrance]], in 42 AC. He was killed in the [[trial by seven]] between the Warrior's Sons and [[Maegor Targaryen]] and his [[Kingsguard]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Dickon Flowers]]\n[[es:Dickon Flowers]]\n[[nl:Dickon Flowers]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flowers, Dickon}}\n[[Category:House Beesbury]]\n[[Category:Faith Militant]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

He bound his house to theirs by marriage. And transformed House Hightower from wealthy but relatively minor kings to the greatest lords of the Reach. Thanks to Lord Lymond's foresight, Highgarden has always defended Oldtown. Allowing the Hightowers to focus on higher pursuits such as learning and trade.|[[Pycelle]]|Oldtown (Histories & Lore)}}\n'''Lymond Hightower''' was a [[King of the Hightower]] during the [[Age of Heroes]].\n\n==Biography==\nWhen the kings of [[House Gardener]] conquered the [[Reach]], Lymond decided to marry into their family rather than fight them. By marrying a daughter of House Gardener, Lymond was able to transform the Hightowers from wealthy but relatively minor kings into the greatest lords of the Reach. Since then, House Gardener, and later on [[House Tyrell]], has always defended [[Oldtown]], allowing the Hightowers to focus on learning and trade.<ref>\"[[Oldtown (Histories & Lore)|Oldtown]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nLymond is not mentioned in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels. ''The World of Ice & Fire'' specifies that Lymond was known as the Sea Lion and fought and killed King Theon III Greyjoy after ceasing to pay tribute to the [[ironborn]] king. He brought back the First Men tradition of [[thrall]]dom long enough to make the captured ironborn work on strengthening the walls of Oldtown.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Hightower, Lymond}}\n[[fr:Lymond Hightower]]\n[[de:Lymond Hohenturm]]\n[[es:Lymond Hightower]]\n[[it:Lymond Hightower]]\n[[nl:Leymond Hoogtoren]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0434 \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Hightower]]\n[[Category:Kings of the Hightower]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hightower]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

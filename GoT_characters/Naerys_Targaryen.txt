She was an ancestor of [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nQueen Naerys was the mother of [[Daeron II Targaryen]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys Targaryen]] by her brother-husband, [[King]] [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], who had an affair with their cousin, [[Daena Targaryen]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nNaerys and her children are mentioned in [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree Regency Conquest of Dorne era}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Naerys was the sister of Aegon IV, who was also her husband, and the legendary Prince Aemon, called the Dragonknight. Naerys had the classic Targaryen looks, a very fine and delicate beauty. She was very slender and small, with big purple eyes and fine, pale, porcelain skin, near translucent.\n\nAccording to semi-canon sources, she almost died in the cradle and was sickly for most of her life. She was a devout follower of the [[Faith of the Seven]], and once Daeron was born she asked Aegon to release her from her vows so she could join the Faith but he refused her. She was unhappy in her marriage and it was said only her son Daeron or her brother Aemon could make her smile. Her brother, Prince Aemon championed her against the slanders of Ser Morgil and was rumored to, not only have loved her, but also to be the true father of Daeron II. Much later in her life she gave birth to a daughter, Daenerys.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Naerys}}\n[[de:Naerys Targaryen]]\n[[es:Naerys Targaryen]]\n[[nl:Naerys Targaryen]]\n[[pl:Naerys Targaryen]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d]]\n[[ro:Naerys Targaryen]]\n[[zh:\u5948\u4e3d\u8bd7\u00b7\u5766\u683c\u5229\u5b89]]\n[[Category:Queens|Targaryen, Naerys]]\n[[Category:Nobility|Targaryen, Naerys]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

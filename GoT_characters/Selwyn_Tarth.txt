He is the ruler of [[Tarth]], an island located in [[Shipbreaker Bay]] in the [[Stormlands]]. He trained his daughter [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] to be an accomplished warrior. After the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Lord Selwyn declared for [[Renly Baratheon]] and sent Brienne to join his army.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nAfter Brienne defeats [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] in single combat, King Renly is impressed by the warrior-woman's prowess and states that she is everything her father said she was and more.<ref>\"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]\"</ref> When [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] meets Brienne for the first time, he spends a moment trying to recall Tarth, then remembers that its lord is her father, Selwyn of House Tarth.<ref>\"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nWhen the captured Brienne is about to be raped by [[Locke]] and then by his men, Jaime successfully stops them by promising Lord Selwyn would pay a high ransom for his only surviving child's return, but only if Brienne's honor remains \"unbesmirched.\" Jaime tells Locke that Tarth is famous as \"the Sapphire Isle\" because it is the location of all sapphire mines in Westeros, and Lord Selwyn will give him Brienne's weight in sapphires for her release. Locke agrees and calls off his men before they can rape Brienne.<ref>\"[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]\"</ref>\n\nBrienne subsequently points out to Jaime in private that Tarth is called \"the Sapphire Isle\" because of the blue of the surrounding waters - there are no sapphire gemstones. She realizes Jaime must have known this, but embellished her father's wealth in order to convince Locke to leave her unharmed.<ref>\"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]\"</ref>\n\nLord Selwyn responds to Locke's ransom demand via [[raven]], offering a ransom of three hundred [[Currency|Gold Dragons]] in exchange for Brienne's release. Unfortunately, Locke became so convinced by Jaime's previous spur of the moment lie to save Brienne that he refuses Selwyn's offer, and will settle for nothing less than literally Brienne's weight in sapphire gemstones. Selwyn's messages insist there are no sapphires on Tarth but Locke simply thinks he is refusing to pay. Locke and his men decide to entertain themselves by putting Brienne into [[Harrenhal]]'s bear pit, but she is saved by Jaime's intervention.<ref>\"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\n[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] tells Brienne at [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's wedding]] that as \"Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter, that makes you a lady whether you want to be or not\".<ref name=\"E32\">\"[[The Lion and the Rose]]\"</ref>\n\nBrienne mentions her father when she encounters [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. She reminisces how Lord Selwyn told her that it was not proper behavior for a lady to pursue martial activity. However, Brienne did not listen and continued fighting other boys until her father relented and personally trained her as a warrior.<ref>\"[[The Children]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\nBrienne recounts to [[Podrick Payne]] how her father held a ball for her and invited dozens of young highborn suitors.<ref>\"[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]] ===\nAt [[Riverrun]], Brienne mentions who she is a second time while attempting to convince [[Brynden Tully]] to join [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] in the [[North]]. He cuts her off, stating that he knows and admires her father.<ref>\"[[No One]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Tarth family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Selwyn Tarth is described as a good man of fifty-four years old. Also known as \"The Evenstar\", he is a widower remembered by Brienne as having a new woman every year. \n\nLord Selwyn initially declares House Tarth's support for Renly; after Renly's death, it isn't clearly stated whom he supports. He certainly does not send any troops to aid Stannis, but it's unclear if he bends the knee to Joffrey, outright lends his support to him, or simply adopts an isolationist stance, like Lord Gulian Swann.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Tarth navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarth, Selwyn}}\n\n[[de:Selwyn Tarth]]\n[[es:Selwyn Tarth]]\n[[nl:Selwyn Tarth]]\n[[pl:Selwyn Tarth]]\n[[pt-br:Selwyn Tarth]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0432\u0438\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0442]]\n[[Category:Lords|Tarth, Selwyn]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tarth]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

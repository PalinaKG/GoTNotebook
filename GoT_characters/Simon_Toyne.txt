He was killed by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nSimon Toyne was the leader of the Kingswood Brotherhood, a band of outlaws and bandits opposed to the rule of [[House Targaryen]]. They inhabited the [[Kingswood]], a large area of woodland south-east of [[King's Landing]]. Roughly twenty years before the events of the series, King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] ordered the Brotherhood destroyed, a mission led by Ser Barristan Selmy of the [[Kingsguard]]. Selmy himself killed Toyne with a counter-riposte, a move witnessed by the then-[[squire]] [[Jaime Lannister]].<ref name=\":0\">\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nJaime recalls Selmy killing Toyne and cites Selmy's counter-riposte as the finest sword move he'd ever seen. Selmy says that Toyne was a good fighter, but lacked stamina.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Simon was a descendant of [[House Toyne]]. His background and fate are the same as in the show.\n\nHouse Toyne was formerly a house of honor, with one member - Ser\u00a0[[Terrence Toyne]] -\u00a0serving in the Kingsguard of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]]. When Aegon IV found this knight abed with one of his mistresses, he had him executed in a horrible fashion. The knight's brothers declared war against [[House Targaryen]], slaying the infamous Dragonknight, Ser [[Aemon Targaryen (Dragonknight)|Aemon Targaryen]]. Simon was their descendant and the last of his line.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toyne, Simon}}\n\n[[de:Simon Toyn]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0422\u043e\u0439\u043d]]\n[[Category:Outlaws]]\n[[Category:House Toyne|Simon]]\n[[Category:Kingswood Brotherhood|Simon]]\n[[Category:Nobility|Toyne, Simon]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

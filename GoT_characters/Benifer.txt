He was the only one out of the four of Maegor's Grand Maesters who wasn't beheaded. During [[Jaehaerys Targaryen's uprising]] in [[Timeline#The Sons of the Dragon & the Faith Militant uprising|48 AC]], Benifer fled [[King's Landing]], leaving the king unable to send [[raven]]s to those still loyal to him. After Maegor's subsequent death, Benifer returned and served King Jaehaerys as Grand Maester.<ref name=\"Maegor\"/>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''Fire & Blood'', Benifer suggested a [[marriage]] between King Maegor and Lady Clarisse Dayne of [[Starfall]]. When he abandoned Maegor during Prince Jaehaerys's rebellion, he secretly went into a short self-[[exile]] in [[Pentos]]. Upon Maegor's death, Benifer was invited back to the capital by the new king. He returned and was reinstated as Grand Maester.\n\nIn 56 AC, Princess Aerea, daughter of [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon the Uncrowned]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Queen Rhaena]], fell severely ill. Benifer and [[Septon]] [[Barth]] attempted to heal the girl, but their efforts failed and she soon died. Benifer and Barth were traumatized by the princess's death.\n\nBenifer died of the Shivers during an epidemic in King's Landing in 59 AC. He was succeeded as Grand Maester by Elysar.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Grand Maesters]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

But Visenya simply flew her dragon to a balcony of the Eyrie where the boy king was playing and gave the boy a ride around the castle... in return for his mother's submission.|[[Petyr Baelish]]|Knights of the Vale}}\n'''Sharra Arryn''' was the widow of a [[King of the Mountain and the Vale]] and the [[King|Queen]] [[Regent]] of [[Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]], ruling in the name of her son [[Ronnel Arryn (king)|Ronnel Arryn]], at the time of the [[War of Conquest]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Visenya_takes_the_Eyrie.jpg|thumb|Visenya Targaryen flew her dragon directly over the mountains to the Eyrie.]]\nQueen Sharra was alongside her son when [[Visenya Targaryen]] flew to the [[Eyrie]] demanding submission. Ronnel bent the knee to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and surrendered the [[Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]] in exchange for a ride atop [[Vhagar]].<ref>\"[[The Vale]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\n\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, it is unknown to which house Sharra Arryn was born. She was regarded as the most beautiful woman in [[Westeros]].\n\nWhen Aegon made his intentions known to the Kings of Westeros, Queen Sharra, who was ten years older than Aegon, sent him a portrait of her and a marriage proposal with the condition he made her son his heir. Aegon refused (quipping that he already had two wives and needed no more), prompting the Vale to resist the invasion. At the Battle of Gulltown, Visenya Targaryen was defeated, but she managed to burn the Arryn fleet. Rather than join the alliance of the [[Kingdom of the Reach]] and the [[Kingdom of the Rock]], Sharra adopted a siege strategy, closing the [[Bloody Gate]] and positioning her land armies to massacre the Targaryen army if it tried to force the mountain pass. The result was that the strength of the Vale was not present at the [[Field of Fire]].\n\nNevertheless, by the time Sharra returned to the Eyrie she found Visenya already there, with King Ronnel sitting on her lap, asking his mother if he could take a ride on Vhagar \u2013 who was perched on a nearby battlement. The implicit threat of her son being held by Visenya was enough to make Sharra surrender. After exchanging pleasantries, she promptly and politely brought the crowns of the Vale to Visenya, who then took Ronnel for his ride.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Arryn navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arryn, Sharra}}\n\n[[de:Sharra Arryn]]\n[[ru:\u0428\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0430 \u0410\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:House Arryn|Sharra]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

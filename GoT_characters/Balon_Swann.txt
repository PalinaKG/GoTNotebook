He is the second son of Lord Gulian Swann, the head of House Swann.\n\nAt Cersei's order, Ser Balon replaces Ser [[Preston Greenfield]] in the Kingsguard, following the latter's\u00a0death in the [[Riot of King's Landing]]; Tyrion approves of her choice. In sharp contrast to most of Cersei's appointments, Ser Balon is quite suitable to be a member of the Kingsguard: he is highborn, valiant, courtly, skilled at arms,\u00a0good with a lance, better with a morningstar, and superb with the bow.\n\nIn the TV series, Ser Preston is mentioned as still being alive at the time of Joffrey's wedding in Season 4. Nevertheless, a new member of the Kingsguard is present in Season 3's \"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]\". In the books, after Sandor Clegane deserted his post during the Battle of the Blackwater his place on the Kingsguard was filled by Ser Osmund Kettleblack, but because neither Ser Osmund nor his subplot have been introduced in the TV series, it is possible that it was Balon who replaced Sandor in the TV continuity.\n\nSer\u00a0Balon also previously competed against\u00a0Jaime in the books. Jaime\u00a0discusses Balon's\u00a0renown as a tourney knight and melee fighter upon meeting him in the White Tower as a fellow Kingsguard, and the two share a common respect for each other, where Balon\u00a0is eventually assigned by Jaime as the primary Kingsguard for the King.\n\nSer Balon is the first to testify in the [[court trial of Tyrion Lannister]]. Unlike the rest of the witnesses, his testimony is wholly true, objective and in favor of Tyrion: he praises Tyrion for his bravery in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]; he claims that he thinks Tyrion is innocent; when describing how Tyrion beat Joffrey following the Riot of King's Landing, he claims that it was only a fit of wroth. Tyrion wonders why offer a witness that believes him innocent, until Ser [[Meryn Trant]] comes to testify. Tyrion realizes then that Cersei deliberately began with a man known to be honest, and milked him for all he would give, and every witness to follow will tell a worse tale.\n\nSer Balon is the only of the current Kingsguard that Jaime, as the Lord Commander, has nothing negative to comment about, and does not need to put him in his place. Jaime inquires Ser Balon about the loyalty of his brother Donnel, pointing out that he managed to serve four kings ([[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]). Ser Balon uneasily answers that Donnel erred, but he is Tommen's man now. Jaime demands to know how Ser Balon will act in case his brother gives his sword to another usurper and attempts to kill Tommen, emphasizing that he found himself once in [[Sack of King's Landing|a similar situation]]. Ser Balon swears that he'll never act that same way Jaime did. Jaime is satisfied with the answer.\n\nIn the fourth novel, Cersei also sends a Kingsguard to take her daughter Myrcella back from Dorne to King's Landing, but it is Ser Balon, not Jaime, who in turn is sent away to pacify the Riverlands. Contrary to Jaime's furtive mission in the TV series, Ser Balon goes to Dorne in an official capacity. He has two more tasks to carry out: to deliver Gregor Clegane's skull\u00a0to the Martells, and to play his\u00a0part in a secret plan, whose details are revealed in the following novel -\u00a0Cersei's scheme to assassinate Trystane Martell. Unknown to Cersei, the\u00a0Martells have friends at the court who inform Doran about her vile plan.\n\nSer Balon's retinue consists of three knights, eight squires, twenty men-at-arms, sundry grooms and servants. Bronn is not among them. They arrive at\u00a0Dorne without any hostile encounters.\n\nWhile Ser Balon is on his way to Sunspear, Doran's daughter Arianne attempts\u00a0to execute Tyene's plan to crown Myrcella, in order to provoke the\u00a0Lannisters and Tyrells to attack Dorne. On the way to Hellholt, Arianne and\u00a0her companions are intercepted by Areo Hotah. During the confusion moments,\u00a0one of Arianne's companions - Ser Gerold \"Darkstar\" Dayne - slashes at Myrcella and escapes. She survives but is disfigured permanently.\n\nDoran fears that once Ser Balon looks at Myrcella and reports the\u00a0Lannisters, they will blame the Martells and declare a war against them,\u00a0while Dorne is no ready yet for an open confrontation. To buy time, the\u00a0Martells' bannermen delay Ser Balon for weeks by holding feasts, jousts and\u00a0hunting trips for him.\n\nWhen Ser Balon finally arrives at Sunspear, he is welcomed amicably by\u00a0Doran: a feast is held for him, and is given a place of high honor next to\u00a0Arianne. Arianne flirts with Ser Balon, while Doran converses with him\u00a0without showing any sign that he is aware of the plot to murder his son.\u00a0Some of the attending people, most notably the Sand Snakes and Daemon Sand,\u00a0show signs of disapproval (perhaps thinking that the\u00a0Lannisters' envoy should have been given a completely different sort of \"welcome\"). Areo Hotah keeps an eye\u00a0on them, ready to react if they stir up troubles.\n\nAreo Hotah watches Ser Balon intently during the feast. He estimates that\u00a0Ser Balon is a more capable warrior than [[Arys Oakheart]], and less likely to be\u00a0seduced by Arianne. Hotah also notices that Ser Balon is strangely nervous: he barely\u00a0eats anything, sweats profusely despite the coolness in the hall, and is unnerved by\u00a0Doran's suggestion that he and Trystane will travel to King's Landing by\u00a0ship. The reason for his restlessness is soon revealed.\n\nDoran invites Ser Balon to the Water Gardens, where Myrcella is. Then he\u00a0excuses himself and leaves to his solar, where he holds a secret meeting\u00a0with Hotah, his daughter and nieces. He reveals Cersei's plot to them. The\u00a0Sand Snakes are shocked not only by the plot itself, but also by the fact\u00a0that a Kingsguard knight is assigned to participate it. Obara, hot-tempered\u00a0and aggressive as ever, suggests to pay Cersei back with the same coin: she\u00a0sent them a skull, and they will send her back the skulls of Ser Balon and\u00a0his escorts. Doran forbids Obara to harm Ser Balon due to the [[guest right]].\n\nEventually, the Martells come up with a plan: the next day, they will travel to the\u00a0Water Gardens, where Myrcella, instructed by Arianne, will tell Ser Balon\u00a0that Darkstar injured her, lie about Ser Arys's part, and ask him to hunt\u00a0down the man who hurt her;\u00a0Ser Balon will probably do as Myrcella asks;\u00a0Obara will lead him to High Hermitage to beard Darkstar in his den.\n\nThe plan works perfectly: Ser Balon believes Myrcella's partly-false story.\u00a0He sends the Lannisters a report that totally clears the Martells, then he and Obara go to\u00a0High Hermitage. Currently they are still hunting for Darkstar.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Kingsguard navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swann, Balon}}\n\n[[ru:\u0411\u0435\u0439\u043b\u043e\u043d \u0421\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d]]\n[[Category:House Swann|Balon]]\n[[Category:Knights|Swann]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

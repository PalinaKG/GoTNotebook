The camp is beset by strong winds. [[Catelyn Stark]] meets with King Renly in his command tent. Ser Emmon and his sworn brother Ser [[Robar Royce]] are outside while [[Brienne of Tarth]] stands watch inside the tent. Hearing Brienne scream the guards rush into the tent with swords in hand. They see Brienne kneeling over Renly\u2019s corpse and assume that she is responsible. The two knights threaten her life. Catelyn tries to intervene but they push her aside. Brienne fights both of them off, killing them.<ref>\"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|5=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Emmon Cuy is a member of the Rainbow Guard as \"Emmon the Yellow\" and hails from House Cuy of Sunflower Hall, a noble house from the Reach. Unlike in the episode, he, [[Robar Royce|Robar Royce,]] and two guards enter Renly's tent just after his King's [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|assassination]]. Cuy blames Brienne for the death and attacks her. One of the guards tries to burn her using a flaming torch, but her cloak is too soaked with blood to burn. Brienne cuts the guard's hand, fights Cuy and the remaining guard, and apparently kills the latter. [[Catelyn Stark]] convinces Robar that Brienne is innocent and he fights off the men-at-arms that follow Cuy, while Catelyn uses an iron brazier to knock Emmon Cuy unconscious, then she and Brienne escape. Ser Emmon and Ser Robar are later killed by Lord Commander Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] in a fit of rage, because of their failure to protect King Renly and allowing Brienne to escape. As he lay dying, Ser Emmon swears it was Brienne that killed Renly, and thus the rumors of this follow her.\n\nWhen Loras was convinced of Brienne's innocence, he was filled with deep remorse for killing Cuy and Royce.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{RenlyKingsguard navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cuy, Emmon}}\n\n[[de:Emmon Cuy]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043c\u043c\u043e\u043d \u041a\u044c\u044e]]\n[[Category:House Cuy|Emmon]]\n[[Category:Knights|Cuy, Emmon]]\n[[Category:Quote needed]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard of Renly Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

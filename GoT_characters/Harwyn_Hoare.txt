He was unruly and useless to his father, and was sent east to vanish. He raided with pirates and fought with mercenaries in [[Essos]].<ref name=\"KM\">\"[[The Kingsmoot]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen Qhorwyn died, Harwyn returned to the Iron Islands for the [[Kingsmoot]] as a candidate. His elder brother [[Harlan Hoare|Harlan]], although under suspicious circumstances, soon fell off his horse and died, and Harwyn was elected without objection. He sailed his father's fleet to [[Westeros]] and conquered an area ten times the size of the Iron Islands in the [[Riverlands]]. The weak riverlords had not expected a commander skilled at both sea and land warfare, but Harwyn had learned more of war than most of his fellow [[ironborn]] from his time in Essos.<ref name=\"KM\"/>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harwyn spent his youth raiding the [[Stepstones]] and visiting the [[Free Cities]] such as [[Volantis]], [[Tyrosh]], [[Braavos]], and [[Lys]]. He was held captive on the [[Basilisk Isles]] for two years, served as a [[sellsword]] in the [[Disputed Lands]] and joined and fought in several battles with the [[Second Sons]].\n\nHe was suspected to have caused the death of his older brother [[Harlan Hoare|Harlan]] in order the ascend to the [[Seastone Chair]], since their father [[Qhorwyn Hoare|Qhorwyn]] died just six days after Harlan. Harwyn invaded the [[Riverlands]], with one hundred [[ironborn]] longships landing south of [[Seagard]] before traveling to Blue Fork. They defeated a small host led Samwell Rivers at [[Tumbleton]], before besting Lady Agnes Blackwood's army once she was betrayed by Lord Lothar Bracken. Harwyn was impressed by Lady Agnes and offered to allow her to be his [[salt wife]] and killed her when she refused.\n\nHarwyn came to blows with the [[Storm King]] Arrec Durrandon at the Battle at [[Fairmarket]]. With the help of lords like Lothar Bracken and Theo Charlton, Harwyn's forces crushed Arrec's army and ended his rule over the Riverlands. The rivermen initially thought themselves independent and celebrated until Harwyn retained control. Lord Bracken had hoped to be the new [[River King]] and rose in rebellion six months later, only to fail and starve to death in a crow cage.\n\nMost of Harwyn's rule was spent suppressing rebellions in the Riverlands. He died in bed with a salt wife at the age of 64 and was succeeded as [[King of the Isles and the Rivers]] by his son Halleck Hoare, who was later succeeded by his own son [[Harren Hoare]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoare, Harwyn}}\n[[de:Harwyn Hoffartt]]\n[[es:Harwyn Hoare]]\n[[it:Harwyn Hoare]]\n[[nl:Harwyn Rijp]]\n[[zh:\u54c8\u5c14\u6e29\u00b7\u970d\u5c14]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043d \u0425\u043e\u0430\u0440]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Kings of the Iron Islands]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hoare]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

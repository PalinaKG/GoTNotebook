Look at it now... a blasted ruin.|[[Tywin Lannister]] to [[Arya Stark]], referring to [[Harrenhal]]|A Man Without Honor}}\nKing '''Harren Hoare''', better known as '''Harren the Black''' and '''Black Harren''', was an [[ironborn]] King who ruled over the [[Iron Islands]] and the [[Riverlands]] from his castle, [[Harrenhal]].\n\n== Biography ==\nHarren the Black was an [[ironborn]] King who ruled over the [[Iron Islands]] and the [[Riverlands]] from his castle, [[Harrenhal]]. Harrenhal was the biggest castle in the entire history of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and was built to be invulnerable to any attack by land.<ref name=\":0\">\"[[A Man Without Honor]]\"</ref>\n\nHowever, when [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] [[War of Conquest|invaded]] the [[Seven Kingdoms]], King Harren's vassals from the Riverlands, led by [[Edmyn Tully]], revolted against him, while Aegon the Conqueror unleashed his dragon, [[Balerion]] the Black Dread against the massive stronghold.<ref>\"The Complete Guide to Westeros: The Field of Fire\" featurettes confirm Aegon used his three dragons only in the Field of Fire.</ref> The [[King of the Isles and the Rivers]] and his [[House Hoare|sons]] perished as dragonflame consumed Harrenhal, leaving behind blackened and melted ruins.<ref name=\":0\" /> With his armies destroyed, he was replaced with [[House Greyjoy]].\n\n== In the books ==\n\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harren the Black was the last King of the Iron Islands and the Riverlands, grandson of Harwyn Hardhand, a [[King of the Iron Islands]] who took the [[Trident]] from Arrec, the [[Storm King]] (grandfather of [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]]). Harren's father extended their domains further east by conquering even more territory from the [[Kingdom of the Stormlands]], advancing east from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Narrow Sea and south to the [[Blackwater Rush]] (more or less the area of the later [[Crownlands]]).\n\nHarren the Black was a vain, bloody tyrant hated by his vassals. His cruelty became legendary across Westeros. Eventually, Harren's cruelty backfired at him: Edmyn Tully and the rest of the lords of the Riverlands turned against him during the War of Conquest.\n\nHarren had a very long reign: he had been king for forty years by the time of the War of Conquest. Argilac Durrandon was a strong king and managed to stem the tide of ironborn expansion, starting when he became king 20-30 years before the War of Conquest. Even so, Harren focused on strengthening his hold on the large territories that House Hoare already held, pouring massive resources into finishing Harrenhal (breaking the backs of thousands of enthralled Rivermen).\n\nHarren's growing strength and expansionist mindset indirectly led to the War of Conquest, or at least its immediate cause. After so many years Argilac was starting to grow old, and with only one daughter as an heir, he feared that Harren would sense weakness and mount another major invasion against the Stormlands. Argilac therefore proposed a marriage-alliance to Aegon Targaryen, whose dragons could stop Harren. Aegon declined the offer, however, pointing that he already had ''two'' wives - and that the vast lands that Argilac promised as dowry (from Gods Eye to the Blackwater) were in fact still held by Harren (and Aegon would only gain them if they succeeded). Aegon did give a counter-offer, that Argilac's daughter could marry his best friend (and rumored bastard brother) [[Orys Baratheon]]. Argilac was incensed at giving his daughter's hand in marriage to a bastard, so he cut off the hands of Aegon's envoy and mailed them back to Dragonstone in a box, saying they were the only hands he would ever receive from him. Aegon responded by calling his bannermen, and announcing that he intended to conquer not merely the Stormlands or the ironborn, but all of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n[[de:Harren Hoffartt]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439]]\n[[ro:Harren Hoare]]\n[[fr:Harren Chenu]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoare, Harren}}\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hoare]]\n[[Category:Kings of the Iron Islands]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Lords of Harrenhal]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

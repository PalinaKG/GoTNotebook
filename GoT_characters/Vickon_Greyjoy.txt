In exchange for their allegiance, Aegon allowed the ironborn to choose their new leader. They chose Vickon Greyjoy: his House was one of the most prominent in the Isles, claiming descent from the legendary [[Grey King]]. However, he was made Lord of the Iron Islands, not a King. Because of this, the [[Kingsmoot]] continued to just crown Vickon's descendants as their leader. <ref>\"[[House Greyjoy (Histories & Lore)|House Greyjoy]]\"</ref>\n\n== In the books ==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Vickon Greyjoy's story is the same.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greyjoy, Vickon}}\n[[de:Vickon Graufreud]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0436\u043e\u0439]]\n[[fr:Vickon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Lords Reaper of Pyke|Vickon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Iron Islands]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

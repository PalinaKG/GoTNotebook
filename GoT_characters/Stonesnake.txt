He was killed by [[Free Folk|wildlings]] while scouting the [[Skirling Pass]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nStonesnake is a ranger of the [[Night's Watch]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nAfter meeting the force led by [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] at the [[Fist of the First Men]], [[Qhorin]] selects Stonesnake, [[Harker]], and [[Borba]] for a scouting party to ambush a group of [[Free Folk|wildling]] lookouts. They are joined by [[Jon Snow]].<ref>\"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]\"</ref> They locate and surprise the lookouts, killing all but one of them. Jon is left to execute the wildling survivor, [[Ygritte]].<ref>\"[[The Old Gods and the New]]\"</ref> Jon does not return and they return for him. They pick up his tracks but are ambushed by wildlings. Harker, Stonesnake and Borba are killed while Qhorin is captured. Jon had spared the captive and she leads him into a similar ambush. Jon blames himself for their deaths, and Qhorin tells him to make sure it wasn't in vain. Qhorin seizes the opportunity to insert Jon as an infiltrator in the wildling ranks by berating him for the deaths of the others publicly.<ref>\"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|5=yes|6=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Stonesnake is also a Ranger serving under Qhorin Halfhand. He is short and wiry man, near fifty with a grey beard. He is stronger than he looks, and has the best night-eyes of anyone Jon has ever known. He's dubbed Stonesnake for his ability for climbing mountains and cliffs.\n\nStonesnake leads the mission to scale the [[Skirling Pass]] at night to ambush a trio of wildling watchers. He and Jon kill two of the sentries (one of them is [[Orell]]). He expresses distrust in [[Ygritte]] and later informs Qhorin of what she told Jon.\n\nIn the novels, his fate is uncertain. After his horse panics and breaks its leg, he offers to stay behind and fight the pursuing wildlings like Dalbridge, but Qhorin orders him to make it through the [[Frostfangs]] afoot to the [[Fist of the First Men|Fist]], and to tell [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] what they saw. Jon watches as Stonesnake goes away, and fears that he has no chance. Stonesnake has not been mentioned since. While it has not been confirmed that he died, according to the novels appendix he was lost afoot in the Skirling Pass.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0417\u043c\u0435\u044f]]\n[[zh:\u77f3\u86c7]]\n[[Category:Quote needed]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]\n[[Category:Casualties of the conflict beyond the Wall]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

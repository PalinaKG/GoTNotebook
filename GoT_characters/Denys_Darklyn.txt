The Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister, refused.|[[Varys]]|The Defiance of Duskendale}}\nLord '''Denys Darklyn''' was the [[Lord of Duskendale]] during the reign of [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Aerys II Targaryen]] and the last head of [[House Darklyn]].<ref name=\"Duskendale\">\"[[The Defiance of Duskendale]]\"</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nDenys Darklyn was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of House Darklyn who at some point became the Lord of [[Duskendale]].<ref name=\"Duskendale\" />\n===The Defiance of Duskendale===\nLord Darklyn petitioned King Aerys II for a charter that would allow him to levy his own port fees and taxes. [[Tywin Lannister]], the [[Hand of the King]], refused. Knowing the bad relationship between the king and his Hand, Denys invited Aerys himself to Duskendale to discuss this petition. The king accepted, against the counsel of Tywin, and traveled to Duskendale with only Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]] and a small retinue. Denys ambushed and seized Aerys the moment he arrived outside the city gates, killing Ser Gwayne and the retinue. Aerys was thrown in the dungeons and tortured with petty cruelties such as having his beard pulled. Lord Tywin immediately raised the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army and laid siege to Duskendale with naval support from the [[Royal Fleet]], but Denys threatened to kill the king at the first signs of an assault.<ref name=\"Duskendale\" />\n\nAfter six months of siege, Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] infiltrated the city disguised as a beggar and rescued the king and took an arrow to the chest while narrowly escaping. Lord Denys then surrendered and begged mercy from King Aerys. Denys and the rest of House Darklyn were [[Execution|executed]] on the king's orders.<ref name=\"Duskendale\" />\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Denys is not mentioned to be a knight. Besides this, his story is the same.\n\nIn ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] arrives at Duskendale, searching for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. An unnamed maester tells her the history of House Darklyn, particularly about Denys.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darklyn, Denys}}\n\n[[it:Denys Darklyn]]\n[[fr:Denys Darklyn]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0441 \u0414\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Members of House Darklyn]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.

He was the younger brother of [[Aerys II Targaryen]], uncle of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], and [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and great-uncle of [[Jon Snow]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nDaeron was the youngest son of King [[Aegon V Targaryen]]. He was betrothed to [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna Redwyne]], but she took a great dislike to his \"twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair\", and their engagement ended when Olenna seduced her sister [[Viola Redwyne|Viola]]'s intended husband [[Luthor Tyrell]].<ref>\"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nAfter [[Margaery Tyrell]] unexpectedly becomes a widow when King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] is [[Purple Wedding|murdered at their wedding feast]] and worries she will not be married to his younger brother and successor [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], her grandmother Olenna recounts the story of how she escaped her engagement to Daeron as a lesson on how to manipulate Tommen into wanting their marriage.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Olenna Tyrell]] tells [[Sansa Stark]] over supper at their first meeting about how she ended her betrothal to a Targaryen prince, but he is never specifically named.\n\nIn ''The World of Ice and Fire'' companion book, this Prince is revealed as Daeron Targaryen, the youngest son of King [[Aegon V Targaryen]]. ''The World of Ice and Fire'' reveals that Olenna was not the one to break off the betrothal, but Daeron himself because he preferred the companionship of Ser Jeremy Norridge, a young knight that he befriended while [[Squire|squiring]] together at [[Highgarden]]. The two later die together in battle quashing a small rebellion. It should be pointed out that the sourcebook is written in-universe, as though it were a historical text by a Maester. This in-universe narrator may therefore not have known about what (or who) Olenna was doing behind the scenes to ensure her preferred outcome.\n\nIn the [[Fire and Blood|final episode]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' [[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]], [[Aemon|Maester Aemon]] says King Aegon V Targaryen was his younger brother and Aegon V's successor was his son King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] better known as the Mad King. In ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels the Mad King's father was King Jaehaerys II Targaryen, King Aegon V's second son and Prince Daeron's older brother. Removing this generation from ''Games of Thrones'' canon makes conjecture based off the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels and ''The World of Ice and Fire'' companion book more difficult.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n\n[[fr:Daeron Targaryen (fils d'Aegon V)]]\n[[pl:Daeron I Targaryen]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d (\u0441\u044b\u043d \u042d\u0439\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430 V)]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Daeron (son of Aegon V)}}\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

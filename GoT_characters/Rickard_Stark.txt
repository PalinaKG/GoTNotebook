The [[North]] is one of the constituent regions of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and House Stark is one of the [[Great House]]s of the realm. House Stark rule the region from their seat of [[Winterfell]] and Rickard also held the title [[Lord of Winterfell]].

He was saved from drowning by Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] during the siege of [[White Harbor]] by the outlaw [[Sea Kings]].<ref>\"[[The Iron Throne]]\"</ref> Rickard is the father of [[Brandon Stark (son of Rickard)|Brandon]], [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and [[Benjen Stark]]. He arranged for the betrothal of his daughter Lyanna Stark to [[Robert Baratheon]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]]. He also betrothed his son and heir Brandon Stark to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]], the daughter of [[Hoster Tully]], [[Lord Paramount of the Riverlands]]. Both engagements were broken when Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] Lyanna.\n\nWhen Lyanna was kidnapped by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], the son of the King, Rickard's eldest son and heir, Brandon, rode to [[King's Landing]] seeking justice. Aerys II imprisoned Brandon and ordered that Rickard ride south to answer for his son's impertinence. Against advice, Rickard agreed, assuming that the matter would be settled through a trial or a bargain of some kind. Instead, Aerys had Lord Rickard burned alive while Brandon strangled himself trying to save his father.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\nAerys then ordered [[Jon Arryn]] to hand over his ward and new Lord of Winterfell Eddard Stark. Having sworn a sacred oath to protect Eddard, Jon instead rose his banners in rebellion. He was supported by the North, Lyanna's betrothed [[Robert Baratheon]], and [[Hoster Tully]]. This sparked the beginning of the war known as [[Robert's Rebellion]], which led to the near-destruction of House Targaryen and its removal from the [[Iron Throne]].<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nReaching King's Landing, Lord Eddard Stark is greeted by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] in the throne room, who recalls listening to Eddard's father and brother scream as hundreds watched them die at the whim of the Mad King.

As he lists them, he reminds her that House Stark is gone due to the actions of their \"two terrible fathers\" though he doesn't discuss the specifics - her father executing Rickard and Brandon and ''his'' [[Tywin Lannister|father]] orchestrating the [[Red Wedding]].<ref>\"[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]\"</ref>.\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]] ===\n[[Bran Stark]], with the aid of the [[Three-Eyed Raven]], has a [[greensight]] vision of Lord Rickard give some parting words to the young Ned Stark as he prepares to leave [[Winterfell]] to be [[Ward|fostered]] in the [[Eyrie]].

Your father burnt my grandfather alive. He burnt my uncle alive.|[[Jon Snow]] reminds [[Daenerys Targaryen]].|The Queen's Justice}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rickard's role is unchanged. His wife Lyarra, with whom we had his four aforementioned children, was his first cousin once removed (her name was already \"Lyarra Stark\" before they were married). Her father was named Rodrik Stark, and he was the younger brother of Rickard's grandfather Willam Stark. First cousin marriage is not considered [[Incest|incest]] in Westeros.\n\nIn ''A Clash of Kings'', Jaime Lannister explains to Catelyn Stark just how he died: Rickard demanded trial by combat to clear his son's name, assuming he would face a Kingsguard such as Jaime, but the Mad King had him locked in a cage with fire spewing beneath it, saying \"''Fire'' is the champion of House Targaryen\" and mockingly offering that all he had to do to win the trial was not to burn. When Brandon tried to stop his father's death, he ended up strangling himself due to the device the Targaryen men had strapped him to. Jaime did not say how many knights were present, only that Gerold Hightower was there, and (having noticed Jaime's visible disgust at the proceedings)\u00a0told him afterwards\u00a0that they were sworn to defend the king, not to judge him.\n\nIn ''A Storm of Swords'', Jaime offers to swear an oath not to harm [[Brienne of Tarth]] in exchange for being unchained so that the two of them can share watches after they are attacked. When Brienne reminds Jaime about how he broke his oath to the Mad King, Jaime alludes to Rickard's death saying she never cooked anyone in their armor as far as he knows.\n\nRickard's father was Lord Edwyle Stark, son of Willam. Edwyle's sister (Rickard's aunt) married a junior member of [[House Royce]] from the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], and through her the Royces are blood relatives of the Starks. The Royce whom Rickard's aunt married was a member of the cadet branch of the main line of that family known as House Royce of the Gates of the Moon (or perhaps, he was specifically the founder of that cadet branch). Thus Nestor Royce, the head of House Royce of the Gates of the Moon at the time of the War of the Five Kings, is Eddard Stark's second cousin. After hearing of the [[Sack of Winterfell]] and the alleged deaths of his brothers, Eddard's son [[Robb Stark]] felt the need to name a new heir (otherwise the Lannisters would press a claim to Winterfell through Sansa's forced marriage to Tyrion). Eddard's widow Catelyn Stark suggested naming one of the Royces due to this distant blood relationship - either way the point was rendered moot after the deaths of them both and the destruction of the Northern army at the [[Red Wedding]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stark, Rickard}}\n\n[[de:Rickard Stark]]\n[[es:Rickard Stark]]\n[[it:Rickard Stark]]\n[[pl:Rickard Stark]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a]]\n[[zh:\u745e\u5361\u5fb7\u00b7\u53f2\u5854\u514b]]\n[[fr:Rickard Stark]]\n[[Category:Wardens|Stark, Rickard]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of Winterfell|Rickard]]\n[[Category:Members of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

While Irri and the other two tend to Daenerys in the tent, Daenerys asks them if they have seen\u00a0dragons. Irri states that dragons are gone. She is also very skeptical of Doreah's story of dragons coming from a long-destroyed second moon. Irri insists that the moon is a goddess, and not a giant dragon egg as Doreah claims. Jhiqui sides with Irri but Daenerys is intrigued by Doreah's \"dragon egg\" story and asks Irri and Jhiqui to leave her alone with Doreah.<ref>\"[[The Kingsroad]]\"</ref>\n[[File:Lord Snow Irri Dany pregnant.png|thumb|Irri discovers that Daenerys is pregnant.]]\nIrri acts as a translator between Daenerys and her bodyguard [[Rakharo]]. Rakharo protects Daenerys from one of her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]]'s famous rages by whipping him around his throat, though he respects Daenerys's request not to kill him. Irri and Rakharo show mutual puzzlement at her mercy. Irri determines that Daenerys is pregnant and arranges a special dinner to celebrate. Irri tells [[Jorah Mormont]] about Daenerys's pregnancy as she demands Rakharo to find something different than horseflesh for the meal.<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref>\n\nIrri tends to Doreah after Viserys beats her.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref> Irri burns her hands when she tries to handle a dragon egg Daenerys has put into a fire pit, Daenerys was holding the egg without it affecting her.

The khalasar splinters without Drogo and Daenerys smothers him to end his suffering. She builds a funeral pyre for him and stakes Maz Duur within the flames to avenge the loss of her son. Daenerys also puts her eggs within the flames and shocks Irri when she walks in after them. The remains of the khalasar stay around the fire all night. In the morning they find Daenerys alive in the ashes with three [[dragon]]s. Irri swears fealty to Daenerys along with the rest of her people.<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\n[[File:Daenerys & Irri 2x02.png|thumb|Irri mourns Rakharo.]]\nIrri crosses the [[Red Waste]] alongside the rest of Daenerys's khalasar.

Jorah approaches the horse and discovers Rakharo's severed head. She is devastated because, according to Dohtraki belief, unless his body is cremated Rakharo's spirit won't be able to move on to the Night Lands (the afterlife) to ride with his ancestors. Irri is comforted by Daenerys, who tells her that tonight Rakharo will ride with them.<ref>\"[[The Night Lands]]\"</ref> Irri was in love with Rakharo.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/rakharo/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Rakharo entry]</ref>\n[[File:Qarth walls.jpg|thumb|Irri and the horde arrive at Qarth.]]\nAt Qarth, Daenerys joins Irri by her bed and Irri describes the repairs she has made to Daenerys\u2019s clothes. Daenerys thanks Irri, calling her friend. Doreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys recalls her gift from [[Illyrio Mopatis]], saying that the last time a rich man gave her a gown it was because he intended to sell her into marriage with Drogo. Irri offers a Dothraki prayer for Drogo to ride forever in the night lands. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro\u2019s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro\u2019s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a Khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest\u2019s courtesy to Xaro. When Xaro throws a reception for Daenerys in his gardens, Irri and several of the khalasar are also present.<ref name=\"E15\">\"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Irrii Killed Season2.png|thumb|Irri's body in Xaro Xhoan Daxos's manse]]\nDaenerys discovers that some of her Khalasar have been murdered.

The warlock [[Pyat Pree]] reveals that he took the dragons, and she later finds out he was in concert with Xaro. Daenerys also finds out Doreah betrayed her, and had a hand in Irri's death.<ref>\"[[A Man Without Honor]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances||yes|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes|yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170\" spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"square\">\nLord Snow Irri Dany pregnant.png\nDany-jorah-market.png|Irri accompanying [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in the markets of [[Vaes Dothrak]] in \"[[You Win or You Die]]\".\nIrri 1x07.jpg|Irri in \"[[You Win or You Die]].\"\nIrri 1.jpg|Irri and Khalessi\nIrriNightLands.jpg|Irri in \"[[The Night Lands]]\"\nIrri.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAcharia corrected speculation that Irri's death had occurred because she was unable to continue working in the United Kingdom due to work visa problems\u00a0in a [[wikipedia:Reddit#Reddit IAmA|Reddit AMA]], confirming that she could have continued on the show but the writers had decided to write out her character.<ref>[http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uuiw2/amrita_acharia_portrayed_irri_on_game_of/c4yprh0 Reddit]</ref>\n\n[[File:Doreah kills Irri.jpg|thumb|Deleted scene of Doreah killing Irri.]]\nIn a deleted scene, available on Season 2 Blu-ray, it was actually [[Doreah]] who strangled Irri to death, instead of just indirectly betraying her to her death. It must be remembered that this is from a deleted scene and thus it is not canonical and is not officially considered to have actually happened. Exactly why the scene was deleted, whether for plot reasons or simply for time constraints, has not been revealed.\n\nAmrita Acharia gave another interview after her departure, noting that the death scene filmed for Irri actually gave her real bruises, \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to be strangled onscreen because obviously to an extent to make it look real, you really have to be a bit strangled. So I had massive bruises on my neck the next day. I was proud. Battle scars. Death scenes are fun.\"<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/05/interview-with-amrita-acharia/ WinterIsComing.net interview with Amrita Acharia]</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Irri is a Dothraki slave given to Daenerys by Drogo to teach her how to ride. She is ethnically a Dothraki, but was enslaved when her own ''khalasar'' was defeated by another. She is the same age as Daenerys, and is fond of using the Dothraki saying, \"It is known.\"\n\nIrri is usually seen paired with Daenerys's other handmaiden [[Jhiqui]]. In the TV series, however, Jhiqui only appeared briely in one scene during Season 1, it seems that the TV series has functionally condensed both into one character.\n\nIn the books, Irri survives the journey through the Red Waste and the stay in Qarth, and continues to serve Daenerys during her campaign in [[Slaver's Bay]] and her reign in [[Meereen]].\n\nIn the fifth novel, Jhiqui and Irri both develop a crush on Rakharo, who has grown more tall and muscular. They argue whom he would prefer.\n\nFollowing Daenerys's departure from Meereen, Jhiqui and Irri accompany the Dothraki search parties, dispatched across the [[Skahazadhan]] to locate their queen.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n\n[[de:Irri]]\n[[es:Irri]]\n[[it:Irri]]\n[[pl:Irri]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u0440\u0440\u0438]]\n[[zh:\u4f0a\u4e3d]]\n[[fr:Irri]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Handmaidens]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

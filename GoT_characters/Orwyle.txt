Upon the death of the King, Orwyle was present in the meeting in which Queen [[Alicent Hightower]], Ser [[Otto Hightower]] - the [[Hand of the King]] - and Ser [[Criston Cole]], the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], forced the [[small council]] to crown Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] regardless of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] being the designated heir. Orwyle witnessed the death of Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]] - who remained adamant in crowning Rhaenyra - at the hands of Ser Criston.<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==In the books==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels there's no mention of Grand Maester Orwyle, who appears in ''The Princess and the Queen'' and ''The World of Ice and Fire''. He succeeded Grand Maester Mellos in the year 127.\n\nAfter Rhaenyra seized the [[Red Keep]] during the Dance of the Dragons, Orwyle was imprisoned in the black cells, where he wrote his account of the war, trying to put himself in the best light possible, uncertain if he would survive or not. In contrast to [[Eustace]]'s pro-Aegon II writings, Orwyle's account was likely slanted in Rhaenyra's favor. Grand Maester [[Munkun]] based his ''[[The Dance of Dragons, A True Telling|The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling]]'' in Orwyle's already biased account.\n\nIt is very probable that Orwyle was actually a secret Rhaenyra-loyalist since the beginning of the war. The print version of ''The Princess and the Queen'' had large sections cut out and doesn't contain the whole story of the Dance of the Dragons - and in the print version, Daemon Targaryen makes a passing comment that the Blacks secretly have a \"friend\" on the [[Green council]] itself. Of the six men on the Green council, Criston Cole was certainly Rhaenyra's enemy and died fighting her armies; Otto Hightower was executed when Kings' Landing fell (and as Alicent's father was certainly Rhaenyra's enemy); Ironrod was executed alongside Otto, and when to his death loudly insisting that a son inherits before a daughter (instead of pleading that he was a secret Rhaenyra loyalist); similarly, Tyland Lannister was handed over to the torturers, but refused to say where all the money from the old royal treasury was, much less admit that he was somehow a secret Rhaenyra loyalist. The only two remaining members were Lharys Clubfoot and Orwyle, but Clubfoot was Aegon II's most dangerous ally, secreting him and his children out of the capital when it fell, instead of just handing them over to the Blacks. Therefore, by process of elimination, the Blacks' \"friend\" on the Green council was almost certainly Orwyle - which does seem to match with how he was imprisoned instead of executed after King's Landing fell, and went so far as to write a pro-Rhaenyra account of the war while in captivity to try to ingratiate himself with her.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n}}\n<!--Interwiki links-->\n[[de:Orwyl]]\n[[es:Orwyle]]\n[[it:Orwyle]]\n[[nl:Orwyl]]\n[[zh:\u6b27\u7ef4\u5c14]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c]]\n[[Category:Grand Maesters]]\n[[Category:Greens]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Her father married her to Kevan and they have three sons: Lancel and the twins Martyn and Willem. They also have a daughter, Janei. Lancel is their eldest child and Janei the youngest.\n\nAccording to Kevan, Dorna is a gentle soul, never comfortable except at home with friends and kin around her. She prays seven times a day and loves needlework and flowers.\n\nIn contrast to Robert's mocking words in the TV show, Dorna is described \"chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged\" with her lack of chin shared by her father, yet she is still very loved by her husband.\n\nIn his last moments, after being fatally injured by Varys, Kevan's last thought is about Dorna.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Dorna Swyft}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Swyft navbox}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Dorna}}\n\n[[de:Dorna Lennister]]\n[[pl:Dorna Swyft]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n[[zh:\u591a\u5a1c\u00b7\u53f2\u5a01\u4f5b]]\n[[es:Dorna Swyft]]\n[[nl:Dorna Lannister]]\n[[Category:House Swyft|Dorna]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

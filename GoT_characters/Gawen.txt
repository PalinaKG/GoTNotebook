Only the Grand Maester dared object that the throne should pass to his older brother's firstborn son, Prince Aegon.|[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel}}\n'''Gawen''' was [[Grand Maester]] during the reigns of [[Aenys Targaryen]] and [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]]. He was the first of three Grand Maesters [[Execution|executed]] by Maegor.<ref name=\"Maegor\">\"[[Maegor the Cruel]]\"</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nGawen was beheaded by King Maegor for [[treason]], having been the only one to publicly object to Maegor's coronation.<ref name=\"Maegor\" />\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Gawen served as Grand Maester for Kings [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon I]] and [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys]] prior to serving Maegor. He was the third Grand Maester, being the successor of Grand Maester Lyonce. When King Aenys fell ill at [[Dragonstone]] in 41 AC, Gawen had little to no hope in the king's betterment. Gawen protested the coronation of King Maegor, stating that [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Prince Aegon]] is the rightful heir to the [[Iron Throne|throne]]. Gawen was beheaded by Maegor with [[Blackfyre]] for his protests.\n\nIn ''A Storm of Swords'', [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] mentions that Maegor the Cruel's headsman unmade three Grand Maesters with his axe (without mentioning their names). This is the only reference in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels to Gawen, alongside [[Myros]] and [[Desmond]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Grand Maesters]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

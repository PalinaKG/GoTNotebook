Laenor's grandfather died before Jaehaerys did, but then Jaehaerys controversially passed over Rhaenys as heir on account of her sex, instead naming his second son the heir (even though by traditional inheritance law based on primogeniture, a lord's daughter inherits before his younger brother). Jaehaerys's second son himself died a few years later, after which he wanted his grandson through him, [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]], to be named the new heir. Others objected that even if Rhaenys was passed over for being a woman, her father's bloodline through her own son Laenor was still superior.\n\nThe realm divided between those who insisted Laenor should be heir based on primogeniture, and those who said his mother's first cousin Viserys should be heir based on unbroken male-line descent. To avoid a civil war, the elderly Jaehaerys held a [[Great Council]] at [[Harrenhal]], in which all the lords of Westeros held a vote. Viserys won the election by a wide margin, and succeeded to the throne a few years later when Jaehaerys finally died - after which the Velaryons became estranged from the royal court. Tensions remained in the realm early in Viserys's reign as even several of the Great Houses still feel that Laenor was cheated out of the throne.\n\n==Family tree==\n===Paternal===\n{{HotD/House Velaryon family tree}}\n\n===Maternal===\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOn October 5, 2021, HBO announced that [[John Macmillan]] and [[Theo Nate]] had signed on for ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' in the role of Laenor Velaryon, portraying the older and younger versions of the character, respectively. The character breakdown reads as follows:\n{{Quote|Son of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen.|HBO|https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-releases-first-official-teaser-house-dragon }}\n\n==In the books==\nLaenor was the son of Lord Corlys Velaryon and Princess Rhaenys Targaryen. He was one year younger than his sister, Laena. Like their mother, Laenor and Laena were also dragon-riders: Laenor's [[Dragon|dragon]] was [[Seasmoke]]. \n\nIn the Great Council at Harrenhal, an election was held in which all the lords of Westeros chose whether Laenor or his mother's cousin Viserys was the rightful heir to the throne. Viserys won by a wide margin, though many lords did vote for Laenor (even Great Houses such as the Baratheons and Starks).\n\nLaenor was widely rumored to be a homosexual, and that in his youth he was in a relationship with Joffrey Lonmouth.\n\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\n\nLaenor was knighted a fortnight before his wedding with Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen in 114 AC. His groom and likely lover, Ser Joffrey Lonmouth, was mortally wounded by Ser [[Criston Cole]] during the wedding's tourney. Laenor refused to leave Joffrey's side during his passing. Laenor returned to High Tide while Rhaenyra remained at court in [[King's Landing]]. Laenor eventually found a new favorite, the household knight Ser Qarl Correy.\n\nSer Laenor and Princess Rhaenyra had three sons, Princes Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey Velaryon, the last named after Joffrey Lonmouth. It was noted none of the children resembled either Laenor or their mother in appearance, causing many to suspect that the children's real father was Ser Harwin Strong.\n\nLaenor was slain by his friend Qarl over a quarrel in Spicetown in 120 AC. [[King]] [[Viserys I Targaryen]] brought his court and dragons to Driftmark for the funeral. None of Laenor's sons survived the later civil war, the [[Dance of the Dragons]].\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Velaryon navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velaryon, Laenor}}\n\n[[de:Laenor Velaryon]]\n[[es:Laenor Velaryon]]\n[[it:Laenor Velaryon]]\n[[nl:Laenor Velaryon]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0440 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u5170\u5c3c\u8bfa\u00b7\u74e6\u5217\u5229\u5b89]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Velaryon|Laenor]]\n[[Category:HotD/Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

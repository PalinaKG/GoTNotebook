He serves as commander of [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], the eastern-most castle on the [[Wall]]. He is a [[bastard]], born on the [[Iron Islands]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nLord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] tells [[Jon Snow]] that Cotter Pyke's rangers found four [[wights]] outside of Eastwatch and wisely burned their corpses.<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nFollowing the [[Breaching of the Wall]], Cotter's fate remains unknown.<ref>\"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cotter Pyke is the bastard son of a tavern wench. He betrays his common origins by being plain, even rough-speaking, with a broken nose. Despite his origins, Cotter Pyke is also considered to be a highly effective and able commander, and stands high in the ranks of the Night's Watch. He holds a level of disdain for, and is essentially the opposite to, Ser [[Denys Mallister]], the commander of the [[Shadow Tower]], who is a highborn [[Knighthood|knight]].\n\nIn ''\"A Dance with Dragons\"'', Cotter Pyke, not Tormund, is given the assignment of bringing the Wildlings from Hardhome. He and his crew are in [[Massacre at Hardhome#In the books|great danger]], in view of his second report to Jon. Just as Jon arranges a rescue party, [[Mutiny at Castle Black|he is attacked by his own men]]. The commotion makes the people at Castle Black forget about Cotter Pyke's predicament. By the end of the novel, it is unknown what is the status of him and his men, if any of them are still alive.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pyke, Cotter}}\n\n[[de:Cotter Peik]]\n[[pl:Cotter Pyke]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u041f\u0430\u0439\u043a]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Members of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

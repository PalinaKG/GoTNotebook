After Drogo's fall from his horse and subsequent incapacitacion, Jhaqo is one of the several kos that declares himself Khal and takes a portion of the khalasar as his own - twenty thousand riders. Among those who follow him is [[Mago]]\u00a0(who is killed for challenging Drogo in the TV series, but in the book he is still alive for no such challenge\u00a0occurs), who becomes Jhaqo's [[bloodrider]].\n\nMago seizes Eroeh, a Lhazareen girl whom Daenerys saved from him earlier, rapes her and gives her to Jhaqo.\u00a0Jhaqo gives her to his other bloodriders. After the six of them gang-rape her, they cut her throat. Daenerys is filled with deep rage when she hears that. She swears she will pay back both Mago and Jhaqo, and before she is done with them, they will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh.\n\nAt the end of the fifth novel, Jhaqo and about fifty warriors of his khalasar encounter Daenerys while she is in the Dothraki sea, after Drogon has flown her there. His reaction is not mentioned, and it is unknown how the encounter will develop. In the series, it is Khal [[Moro]]'s khalasar who finds Daenerys instead.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Jhaqo]]\n[[es:Jhaqo]]\n[[nl:Jhaqo]]\n[[ru:\u0427\u0445\u0430\u043a\u043e]]\n[[zh:\u8d3e\u79d1]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Khals]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

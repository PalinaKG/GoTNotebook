He refuses to help, as they have only secured the loyalty of [[House Mormont]], and citing that Jon has joined forces with [[Free Folk|wildlings]], whereas the Boltons helped Robett take Deepwood Motte back from the [[ironborn]], who had captured it and terrorized Robett's family and subjects (as well as noting that [[Ramsay Bolton]] might well kill him if he learns of Robett's meeting with the Starks). \n[[File:607 Glover Preview.png|thumb|Robett accosts Sansa on her late brother's marriage.]]\nHe lambastes [[Robb Stark|Robb]], to whom House Glover was sworn, for giving no such help (to Robb's credit, this was his original intention, but he was persuaded otherwise by [[Roose Bolton]]\u00a0- of course, that does not clear\u00a0Robb of responsibility for failing to protect his subjects) and \"taking up with a [[Talisa Stark|foreign whore]]\", ruining his political alliances, thus costing the North the entire war and getting all of his men killed along with him at the [[Red Wedding]]. Despite the protestations of Jon and Sansa, Robett refuses to declare for them, and sends them away empty-handed.<ref name=\"E57>\"[[The Broken Man]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:610_Robett_Declaring.png|thumb|Robett declares Jon King in the North.]]Robett, along with other Northern lords, travels to [[Winterfell]] following the defeat of the Boltons at the [[Battle of the Bastards]], where he and two other lords, [[Wyman Manderly]] and [[Cley Cerwyn]], are berated by [[Lyanna Mormont]] for refusing to help the Stark cause. Robett is the second lord, after Lord Wyman, to declare Jon [[King in the North]]. He apologizes for not participating in the battle, and pledges his allegiance to House Stark and Jon.<ref name=\"E60\">\"[[The Winds of Winter]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]]===\n[[File:701_Robett_and_Lyanna.png|thumb|Lyanna argues against Robett's sexism.]]Along with the rest of the lords of the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], Robett meets with the King in the North to plan for the [[Great War|coming war]] against the [[White Walkers]]. When Jon states that all Northerners will be conscripted, Robett initially objects to the idea of women, especially his granddaughter, being trained for warfare but comes around to the idea after Lyanna Mormont explains her support. He supports Jon's decision on pardoning [[Alys Karstark]] and [[Ned Umber]].<ref name=\"E61\">\"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]\"</ref>\n\nHe is later present when Jon convenes another meeting at Winterfell. There, Robett reads [[Samwell Tarly]]'s letter regarding the vast amount of [[dragonglass]], a substance known to destroy White Walkers,\u00a0on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] and is informed of [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s letter regarding the fact that it would be wise if Jon would bend the knee to [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]\u00a0and join the [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|war]] against [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Despite the wishes of Robett and other noble lords (who are concerned with the [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|turmultous nature]] of Stark-Targaryen diplomacy), Jon still departs Winterfell, leaving Sansa as Lady Regent of the North.<ref>\"[[Stormborn]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:705_Yohn_Robett_and_Petyr.png|thumb|Robett and Lord Royce speak with Littlefinger.]]While Jon is preoccupied with Daenerys and mining the dragonglass, Robett informs Sansa that Jon's absence has shown his arrogance as a King, implying that Sansa herself should take his place. Sansa rejects their proposal and stresses Jon's actions as essential. Privately, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] then suggests killing the troublesome lords, but is rebuffed by Sansa.

He is described as tall and haggard and has brown-grey hair.\n\nRobett has two children, Gawen and Erena. There is no mentioning in the books that he has any grandchildren.\n\nWhen\u00a0Robb Stark\u00a0calls his banners, both Robett and his brother\u00a0Galbart\u00a0ride out from Deepwood Motte, leaving it in the hands of Robett's wife,\u00a0Sybelle. Later it is taken by Asha Greyjoy (named Yara Greyjoy in the show).\n\nAs result of the agreement reached between Vargo Hoat and Roose Bolton, Robett and Ser\u00a0Aenys Frey\u00a0lead a group of northern knights that Vargo brings into Harrenhal, under the pretense that they are captives taken by the Brave Companions. As part of the feint, the northerners are chained, in ragged clothes and many fake injuries. Ser\u00a0Amory Lorch, left by Lord Tywin as castellan of Harrenhal, falls for the trick. Arya Stark, not realizing what is going on, organizes a successful liberation of the captives with the assistance of\u00a0Jaqen H'ghar,\u00a0Biter\u00a0and\u00a0Rorge.\u00a0\n\nAfter Roose takes over Harrenhal, he orders Robett to join up with Ser\u00a0Helman Tallhart\u00a0and march on\u00a0Duskendale. They obey, unaware that Roose deliberately sends them into a trap: the joined forces of Randyll Tarly and the Mountain destroy the northmen troops. Ser\u00a0Helman is killed, while Robett and Harrion Karstark (the last surviving son of Rickard Karstark) are taken captive.\n\nRobb exchanges the captive [[Martyn Lannister]] (who was not killed by [[Rickard Karstark]] in the books) for Robett. Robett arrives in\u00a0White Harbor\u00a0after the prisoner exchange and tries to raise men in the city to retake Deepwood Motte from the ironborn. He is unsuccessful, however, because Lord Wyman Manderly has grown weary of war - secretly, because the Manderlys are feigning peace so they can later turn on the Boltons and Freys. As it turns out, [[Stannis Baratheon]] marches south and [[Second Battle of Deepwood Motte|liberates Deepwood Motte]], retaking it from the ironborn and freeing Robett's wife. However, their children Gawen and Erena are still in the hands of the ironborn,\u00a0being looked after by Asha's aunts at the [[Ten Towers]]. Robett himself remains at White Harbor but may have coordinated with his wife via messenger-raven. At Deepwood Motte itself, Robett's wife commands the remaining Glover forces to openly join Stannis's army, along with several hunters and trackers from their vassal Houses in the Wolfswood such as [[House Forrester]].\n\nDavos arrives at the White Harbor in attempt to gain the support of the Manderlys, but is thrown to jail. Days later, Robett appears at Davos's cell and takes him to a secret room, on the way updates him about the liberation of Deepwood Motte, and that the Boltons intend to hold Ramsay's wedding at Winterfell. He speaks disdainfully about Ramsay, describing him as \"a beast in human skin\". At the secret room, Lord Wyman and the mute ironborn [[Wex]] are. Robett tells Davos what they learned from Wex: [[Skagos|the place]] where Rickon and Osha went. Lord Wyman says he is willing to support Stannis, but providing that Davos finds Rickon.\n\nUnlike in the show, Robett remains loyal to the Starks throughout the books.\n\nThe TV version condensed events at Deepwood Motte so Stannis never liberated it, nor was [[Yara Greyjoy]] captured by Stannis there as she was in the books. Instead, Yara simply receives a letter at the beginning of Season 6 informing the Greyjoys that the Glovers managed to retake Deepwood Motte on their own initiative. This is not implausible given the situation in the novels: the ironborn are strong at sea but simply didn't have the manpower to hold lands and castles in the North during a lengthy occupation, and even the small local forces in the North left after the Red Wedding could wear down the ironborn through simple attrition.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Glover navbox}}\n\n[[de:Robett Glauer]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0442\u0442 \u0413\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440]]\n[[fr:Robett Glover]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glover, Robett}}\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Members of House Glover]]\n[[Category:Lords of Deepwood Motte]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

She became the [[Lord of Storm's End|Lady of Storm's End]] and the wife of Lord [[Steffon Baratheon]], the head of [[House Baratheon]], one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. They had three sons, Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon. She lived with her family in [[Storm's End]]. After [[Robert's Rebellion]], her eldest son assumed the [[Iron Throne]] on the grounds that he had the best claim out of all the rebel leaders, partly because Cassana had Targaryen blood.<ref>\"[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories & Lore)#Varys_and_Petyr_Baelish's_perspectives|Robert's Rebellion]]\"</ref>\n\nCassana and her husband died shortly before Robert's Rebellion when their ship, the ''[[Windproud]]'', sank in [[Shipbreaker Bay]].<ref name = \"s1prop\"/>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nShe has an entry in the ''[[The Lineage and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', as read by [[Eddard Stark]].<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Baratheon family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cassana comes from House Estermont. She married Steffon Baratheon and bore him three sons as in the series. She accompanied him on a trip to Essos. Their ship, the ''Windproud'', sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End on their return voyage. Their bodies were never found.\nAlso, in the books, it was not Cassana who had Targaryen blood but her husband's mother, a daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Cassana}}\n[[de:Cassana Baratheon]]\n[[es:Cassana Estermont]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u5361\u73ca\u5a1c\u00b7\u4f0a\u65af\u8499]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Members of House Estermont]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

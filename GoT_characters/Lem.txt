The night is dark and full of terrors.|Lem to Brother [[Ray]]|The Broken Man}}\n'''Lem''', also known as '''Lem Lemoncloak''', was a rogue member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nLem arrives with two other former members of the Brotherhood in an attempt to extort the band of villagers, which includes Brother [[Ray]] and [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. However, upon learning that the villagers hold nothing of interest he and his companions leave. He and other members of his group were responsible for the slaughter of the villagers, and the hanging of Ray.<ref>\"[[The Broken Man]]\"</ref>\n\nSandor hunts down [[Gatins]], [[Morgan (The Broken Man)|Morgan]], and their cohorts in a forest, killing them. Later he finds [[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Thoros]] preparing to hang them for the unsanctioned attack on the village. While they refuse to allow Sandor to execute the murderers through brutal mutilation, and insist on killing one of the murderers themselves because the raid on the actions have stained the Brotherhood's honor and good name,\u00a0they allow him to hang\u00a0Lem and one other man out of respect for Sandor's more personal loss at their hands. Sandor takes Lem's boots for himself while Lem vainly struggles for air, and is invited to join the Brotherhood's mission to fight up North.<ref>\"[[No One]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances|||||||yes|yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the man known as Lem Lemoncloak is a member of the Brotherhood without banners. His true name is unknown, as \"Lem\" is actually short for \"Lemoncloak\" - after the yellow cloak he wears. He is described as big and brawny, with a soldier look to him, as well as a bushy brown beard and bad teeth. Like most of the Brotherhood, he converts to the Lord of Light, but believes Beric Dondarrion's constant survival after lethal wounds is the result of the healing skills of Thoros, not magic.\n\nLem is one of the Brotherhood members who encounter Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie after they escape from Harrenhal. They escort the youngsters to the Inn of the Kneeling Man. After realizing they are about to be kidnapped, Arya tries to get away, but Lem grabs hold of her. She struggles and breaks his nose, but to no avail. She and her friends are taken to Beric.\n\nFollowing the Red Wedding, the\u00a0Brotherhood finds\u00a0[[Catelyn Stark]]'s body. Despite\u00a0Thoros's objection,\u00a0Beric gives her his flame of life. He dies, and\u00a0Catelyn is reanimated as the monstrous Lady Stoneheart, who\u00a0replaces Beric as the leader of the Brotherhood.\n\nUnder the\u00a0leadership of Lady Stoneheart, the Brotherhood soon falls low, and currently it is no longer different than any outlaw band; they even violate the sacred\u00a0[[guest right]].\u00a0As a result, many of the original members abandon the Brotherhood.\u00a0Lem is among those who remain; it seems that he is quite content with what the Brotherhood turned to be. He participates in the retaliatory hangings of several Freys who were involved in the Red Wedding. Unlike in the show, he has not gone rogue, killing harmless villagers.\n\nAfter Brienne kills [[Rorge]], who found the Hound's helm and impersonated to him (which led to false rumors that the Hound was responsible for the atrocities Rorge's gang performed in [[Saltpans]]), Lem takes the helm and wears it. Thoros strongly disapproves of that, claiming there is nothing good about that helm, nor the men who wore it, but Lem does not listen to him.\n\nSo far in the books, Lem is alive.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[de:Zit]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0438\u043c]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Outlaws]]\n[[Category:Brotherhood Without Banners]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

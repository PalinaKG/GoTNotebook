He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the [[Arakh]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nCohollo, alongside [[Qotho]] and [[Haggo]], accompanies Khal [[Drogo]] to view his bride, [[Daenerys Targaryen]].<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen a drunken [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] threatens Daenerys and her [[Rhaego|unborn child]], Qotho and Cohollo restrain him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\nFollowing the raid of a [[Lhazareen]] village in [[Lhazar]], [[Mago]] defies Drogo. Cohollo, along with his fellow [[bloodrider]]s, steps forward to defend\u00a0Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters in his own hands.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\nDrogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from his horse in front of the ''[[khalasar]]'', a sign of great weakness. Daenerys and then Cohollo kneel to the sides of the khal to check on him, while [[Qotho]] and [[Haggo]] remain mounted. Later, when Qotho takes [[Mirri Maz Duur]] to Drogo and Daenerys's tent, Cohollo accompanies him.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes|||||yes||yes|yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cohollo is the eldest of Drogo's three bloodriders and the most kind to Daenerys. He had saved Drogo from sellswords when he was very young. He's described as a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth.\n\nDuring the wedding of Daenerys and Drogo, Cohollo gives them a ''arakh'' chased in gold. When the three bloodriders attempt to stop the [[Mirri Maz Duur]]'s [[blood magic]] ritual to heal Drogo, Cohollo is killed by [[Aggo (The North Remembers)|Aggo]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[fr:Cohollo]]\n[[es:Cohollo]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043b\u043e]]\n[[zh:\u79d1\u970d\u7f57]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Bloodriders]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

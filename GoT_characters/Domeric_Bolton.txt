According to Roose, Domeric was quiet but accomplished; he read history, played the harp and rode horses as if born on the saddle. Domeric's aunt (his mother's younger sister), Lady [[Barbrey Dustin]], was quite fond of him as he had served as a page for her at [[Barrowton]]. He also served as a squire for Lord [[Redfort]] in the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], who said Domeric had the makings of a tournament champion. Domeric enjoyed the company of Redfort's sons in the Vale and, longing for a brother of his own, rode up the [[Weeping Water]] to seek out his [[Ramsay Bolton|bastard half-brother]] despite his father's forbidding it.\n\nAccording to the Dreadfort's [[Order of Maesters|maester]], Uthor, Domeric died of a sickness of the bowels. Reek once heard Skinner (one of the Bastard's Boys) say that Ramsay had killed his trueborn brother, but he had never dared to believe it. Roose and Lady Dustin, among others, strongly suspect Ramsay murdered Domeric with poison to take his place as Roose's heir. In view of Ramsay's personality, it is very likely that the taboo of [[kinslaying]] means nothing to him, and that he did indeed murder Domeric. Roose, while telling Reek about Domeric, speculates that Ramsay will also murder any trueborn siblings that Walda will give birth to; this is perhaps a foreshadowing of Ramsay's [[Assassination at Winterfell|vile deeds]] in the show (which have not been performed in the books, at least not yet).\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Bolton navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bolton, Domeric}}\n[[de:Domeric Bolton]]\n[[es:Domeric Bolton]]\n[[pl:Domeric Bolton]]\n[[nl:Domeric Bolten]]\n[[zh:\u591a\u7c73\u5229\u514b\u00b7\u6ce2\u987f]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Bolton]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Game of Thrones cut content]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

His mother was the first child and daughter of [[Viserys I Targaryen]], who did not change the succession of the [[Iron Throne]] upon the birth of his sons. This made Jacaerys second in line for the throne.\n\nWhen his grandfather King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] died, his uncle was named King [[Aegon II Targaryen]], on the orders of his step-grandmother [[Alicent Hightower]]. When Rhaenyra heard the news, the [[Dance of the Dragons]] began. By this time, Laenor had died and Jacaerys's mother had remarried her uncle [[Daemon Targaryen]], and had two more sons with him. In order to gain more supporters on the mainland of [[Westeros]], Rhaenyra sent him on his [[dragon]], [[Vermax]], to recruit houses in the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. [[House Arryn]], the house of Jacaerys's grandmother\u00a0[[Aemma Arryn]], were persuaded to join the [[Blacks]]. He also persuaded the [[Starks]] of [[Winterfell]], meaning that the Northern houses all followed his mother.\n\nAfter his grandmother\u00a0[[Rhaenys Velaryon|Rhaenys]] died at the hands of his [[Aemond Targaryen|two]] [[Aegon II Targaryen|uncles]], Rhaenyra sent Jacaerys's younger brothers to [[Essos]] for safety but the youngest came back on his dying dragon. Although his mother forbade it, Jacaerys flew on Vermax to rescue his brother from the enemy fleet. However, the dragon dropped into the sea, where they were both shot numerous times, and where it is said, \"they soaked up more arrows than seawater.\"<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==Family tree==\n===Paternal===\n{{HotD/House Velaryon family tree}}\n===Maternal===\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n== In the books ==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n| Spoiler =\nJacaerys was fifteen-years-old at the start of the civil war which became known as the\u00a0Dance of the Dragons. He rode his dragon,\u00a0Vermax, to the [[Eyrie]],\u00a0[[Sisterton]],\u00a0[[White Harbor]], and\u00a0Winterfell\u00a0to raise support for his mother's claim. After successfully gaining the\u00a0Vale of Arryn\u00a0for the\u00a0blacks,\u00a0he also gained the\u00a0North\u00a0through the\u00a0Pact of Ice and Fire.\n\nJacaerys took part in the\u00a0[[Battle of the Gullet]]\u00a0where Vermax flew too low and crashed into the sea. It was said that Jacaerys leapt free and clung to a piece of smoking wreckage for a few heartbeats until some crossbowmen on the nearest\u00a0ship began loosing quarrels at him. The prince was struck once, and then again. Finally, one quarrel took him in the neck and he was swallowed by the sea.\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Velaryon navbox}}\n}}\n[[de:Jacaerys Velaryon]]\n[[es:Jacaerys Velaryon]]\n[[it:Jacaerys Velaryon]]\n[[nl:Jacaerys Velaryon]]\n[[pl:Jacaerys Velaryon]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043a\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u6770\u5361\u91cc\u65af\u00b7\u74e6\u5217\u5229\u5b89]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velaryon, Jacaerys}}\n[[Category:Blacks]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Velaryon|Jacaerys]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Dragonriders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

She is not of remarkable stature, but wears a necklace of ears around her neck, with each ear coming from a slain foe. Her success in battle has seen her rise high amongst the hill tribes.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nChella accompanies [[Shagga]], [[Timett]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], and [[Bronn]] to the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army encampment when Tyrion promises the hill tribes weapons and autonomy from the [[Eyrie]]. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] agrees to honor the bargain Tyrion has made with them.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref> The Black Ears take part in the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], helping the Lannister forces win the engagement, and several are seen cutting ears off the fallen foes on the battlefield.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\n[[File:TyrionHillTribes.jpg|thumb|Chella is part of Tyrion's entourage as he arrives at King's Landing]]\nChella\u00a0and her men escort\u00a0Tyrion\u00a0to\u00a0[[King's Landing]],\u00a0where he takes his place as Acting\u00a0[[Hand of the King]]\u00a0on behalf of\u00a0Tywin.<ref>\"[[The North Remembers]]\"</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], all members of the Hill tribes receive payment from Tywin and return home.<ref>\"[[Valar Morghulis]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=note|9=note}}\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|yes}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Uncredited appearances\n\n== In the books ==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Chella's background is the same. She is described as\u00a0a small dark woman, flat as a boy, with a throaty chuckle.\n\nThe Black Ears are noted for their habit of collecting the ears of fallen foes. Chella has forty-six ears on her necklace, and boasts that her sons have taken fifty between them. They haven't necessarily killed all of their owners; it is common practice for her tribe to cut the ears off of defeated prisoners as trophies, but they often let them leave with their lives.\n\nChella and more of the Black Ears are among the clansmen who follow Tyrion to the Lannister camp, and subsequently participate the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. Chella takes four ears during the battle.\n\nIn \"''A Clash of Kings''\", Chella and the Black Ears accompany Tyrion to King's Landing, where he is to serve as Hand of the King. He puts them in the Broken Anvil to guard [[Shae]].\n\nPrior to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Tyrion recognizes that the Black Ears and the other hill tribes, while ferocious, are undisciplined and inexperienced at siege-warfare, so he sends them south across the river to the Kingswood to harass the scouts and raid the baggage train of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s army as they approached the city. They perform quite well, destroying Stannis's scouts and screening forces to such an extent that he has no warning of the approach of Tywin's massive reinforcements approaching the city.\n\nIn \"''A Storm of Swords''\", Bronn informs Tyrion that Chella turned up with a dozen Black Ears at the River Gate one morning, but the Lannisters guards chased them off while the Kingslanders threw dung and cheered. Tyrion is enraged at that ingratitude.\n\nChella does not appear in the next novels. In the appendices of \"''A Feast for Crows''\" and \"''A Dance with Dragons''\" she is listed as the chief of the Black Ears.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\u00a0\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Chella]]\n[[es:Chella]]\n[[fr:Chella]]\n[[nl:Chella]]\n[[ru:\u0427\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430]]\n[[zh:\u9f50\u62c9]]\n[[Category:Hill tribes]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Like his trueborn half-brother, [[Stevron Frey]], Ryger admonishes his father to remember his courtesies. Lord Frey rudely dismisses his son and reminds him that he's a bastard born of a milkmaid.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nHe is presumably poisoned by [[Arya Stark|Arya]], as a payback for the [[Red Wedding]].\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|9=yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Frey family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\n\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ryger is a natural son of Lord Frey and a woman who milked goats. He is described as being younger than Stevron Frey, who is 65 years old.\n\nRyger appears on-screen only in one book scene - when Catelyn enters the [[Twins]] to request that Lord Walder grants Robb's army passage over the river. The dialogue in this scene matches the parallel show scene fairly closely.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Frey navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivers, Ryger}}\n\n[[fr:Ryger Rivers]]\n[[de:Ryger Strom]]\n[[es:Ryger R\u00edos]]\n[[ro:Ryger Rivers]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0440 \u0420\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441]]\n[[nl:Reyger Stroom]]\n[[zh:\u83b1\u683c\u00b7\u6cb3\u6587]]\n[[Category:Members of House Frey]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Knights|Rivers, Walder]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

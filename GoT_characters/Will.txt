After an encounter with the [[White Walkers]] beyond the [[Wall]], Will [[Desertion|deserted]] the Watch, and was eventually captured and later [[Execution|executed]] by [[Eddard Stark]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nWill was a ranger of the Night's Watch. He was [[Smallfolk|not of noble birth]], but was posthumously described by [[Benjen Stark]] as a reliable soldier, a \"true ranger\".\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Waymar_Royce,_Gared_&_Will.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Rangers Gared, Ser Waymar Royce and Will depart Castle Black on a ranging beyond the Wall.]]Will, along with [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Waymar Royce]] and [[Gared]], departs from the [[Wall]] to investigate reports of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] in the [[Haunted Forest]] which lies [[beyond the Wall]]. He discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Nearby, he also finds a dead [[wildling girl]] pinned to a tree. Will reports to his companions and leads them back to the scene but the corpses have vanished. Gared sends Will to find the bodies.\n\nWhile Will searches for the wildling corpses, he notices the wildling girl who now is a [[wight]] and stalks him through the trees. Terrified, he runs away from the Wight but arrives to the horrid scene to witness a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]] brutally beheading Gared. The White Walker tosses the severed head at Will's feet.\n\nWill is later found south of the Wall near [[Winterfell]], apparently having gone renegade. He is apprehended and brought before Lord Eddard Stark for justice. Will claims that his companions have been brutally killed by the White Walkers and he fled in terror. Eddard does not believe the story and executes Will as a deserter, beheading him with his [[Valyrian steel]] sword, [[Ice]].\n\nLater, at the feast welcoming [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]] to Winterfell, Eddard asks his brother, Benjen Stark, if he knew the deserter Eddard executed. Benjen responded that the young member of the Night\u2019s Watch was just a lad and he was tough, a true ranger.<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\nLord commander [[Jeor Mormont]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] about Will's execution and that he swore he had seen a white walker killing his companions.<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nWill 1x01.jpg|Will in the haunted forest in \"[[Winter Is Coming]]\".\nWill.jpg|Will in \"Winter Is Coming\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Quotes==\n;Spoken about Will\n{{Dialogue a-b|Eddard Stark|The boy I beheaded... Did you know him?|Benjen Stark|Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true [[Ranger]].|[[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] and [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] talk about Will.|Winter Is Coming}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*After playing the role in the [[Game of Thrones pilot episode|unaired original pilot]], it appeared that Webb would be unavailable to reprise the character for re-shoots and would have to be recast. However, it was later confirmed that Webb would indeed be returning to the role.\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Will is famed for his skills as a tracker and a hunter, a result of his previous career as a poacher. Nobody can move more silent through the forest than Will. After being caught killing a Mallister buck by Lord [[Jason Mallister]]'s woodsmen, he chose to take the black over losing a hand. He has been at the [[Wall]] for four years when the events of the books begin.\n\nIn the TV series, some of Will and [[Gared]]'s story roles have been switched around from the books.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n\n\n[[de:Will]]\n[[es:Will]]\n[[fr:Will]]\n[[ru:\u0423\u0438\u043b\u043b]]\n[[zh:\u5a01\u5c14]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Deserters of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

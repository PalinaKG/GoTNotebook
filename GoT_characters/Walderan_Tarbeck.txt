He ran away and told his wife of Lady Ellyn's designs and Lady Ellyn soon found herself married off to Walderan Tarbeck, Lord of another failing house.|[[Jaime Lannister]]|The Rains of Castamere (Histories & Lore)}}Lord '''Walderan Tarbeck''' was the last [[Lordship|lord]] of [[House Tarbeck]] and of [[Tarbeck Hall]]. He was slain during the [[Reyne Rebellion]] along with the rest of his house.\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter failing to seduce [[Tytos Lannister]], [[Ellyn Reyne]] found herself married to Walderan, due to Tytos's wife [[Jeyne Lannister|Jeyne Marbrand]]'s intervention after Tytos told her of Ellyn's advances. Despite her intentions to improve the wealth and status of [[House Reyne]], Ellyn's marriage to Walderan gave her little advantage, as [[House Tarbeck]] was also a failing house.\n\nWhen the weak-willed Tytos became [[Lord of\u00a0Casterly Rock]], Ellyn's brother\u00a0[[Roger Reyne]],\u00a0[[Lord of Castamere|Lord of]] [[Castamere]], were his most troublesome bannermen. Although Walderan was impoverished when he married Ellyn, his wife used her connections with\u00a0[[House Lannister]]\u00a0to borrow considerable loans from Tytos and rebuild\u00a0[[Tarbeck Hall]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], Tytos's heir, Ser\u00a0[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], tried to quell rebellious lords by demanding the repayment of loans. Walderan rode to [[Casterly Rock]] to address Tytos, but found Tywin at the gates, who had him imprisoned.\n\nHowever, after Ellyn threatened war, Tytos released Walderan with an apology, as well as removing any outstanding debts from the Houses Reyne and Tarbeck.\n\nWhen Tywin summoned the Reynes and Tarbecks to answer for their crimes, the two houses decided to [[Reyne Rebellion|rebel against the Lannisters]], something that Tywin managed to expect. Tywin then led his army to ride for Tarbeck Hall and Castamere without Tytos' consent and knowledge. Walderan was unable to gather his entire forces in time and fought with only his household knights. Eventually, Walderan along with his sons and male relatives were killed in the battle and their heads were then adorned on the spears of the Lannister vanguard as it marched to Tarbeck Hall.<ref>\u201c[[The Rains of Castamere (Histories & Lore)|The Rains of Castamere]]\u201d</ref>\n\n== In the books ==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the lord of House Tarbeck, Walderan was twice widowed with several sons from his first two marriages when he was hastily wed to [[Ellyn Reyne]], the widow of Tion Lannister, supposedly after Ellyn tried to seduce the already-married Tytos Lannister. The marriage bore two daughters and a son.\n\nWhen the weak-willed [[Tytos Lannister]] became Lord of [[Casterly Rock]], Walderan and Ellyn's brother Roger Reyne, Lord of Castamere, were his most troublesome bannermen. Although Walderan was impoverished when he married Ellyn, his wife used her connections with House Lannister to borrow considerable loans from Tytos and rebuild Tarbeck Hall. The sudden increase in House Tarbeck's wealth allowed Walderan to increase the household knights in his service from twenty to five hundred.\n\nWith Lord Tytos disinterested in ruling, Walderan was ostensibly the most powerful lord in the westerlands during the War of the Ninepenny Kings, since Tytos's sons and younger brother Jason were on campaign in the Stepstones alongside Roger Reyne, the Red Lion, Walderan's brother-in-law. However, Walderan was himself ruled by Ellyn.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Tytos's eldest son and heir, [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], determined to restore [[House Lannister]] to its former prestige, began to bring his father's bannermen to heel. He started by demanding the immediate repayment of loans to Casterly Rock. Walderan rode to the Rock hoping to address Tytos and cow him into rescinding his son's edict, but Tywin had him imprisoned. In response, Ellyn took three Lannisters hostage (two Lannisters of Lannisport and Stafford Lannister). Ellyn let Tytos know that she would kill the Lannisters if he harmed her husband. Although Tywin advised his father\u00a0to send Walderan back in three pieces, Tytos insisted upon a peaceful solution. Tywin's younger brother, Ser [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], exchanged Walderan at Castamere, the seat of Roger the Red Lion.\n\nA year later, Tywin moved against the Reynes and Tarbecks, commanding them to present themselves at Casterly Rock to answer for their crimes; when they refused, Tywin had the pretext he needed to exterminate both rebellious houses. Tywin's forces attacked so quickly Lord Walderan had no time to gather his bannermen, and was only able to gather his household knights for battle. Walderan was quickly defeated by Tywin's host, with his last surviving son from his first marriage killed in battle. Walderan expected to be ransomed by Tywin, but Tywin instead ordered him executed, along with every surviving male member of House Tarbeck. The heads of Walderan, two sons from his second marriage, his other kin in the host, and his soldiers were then put on display when Tywin continued to Tarbeck Hall.\n\nWalderan's widow, Lady Ellyn, and last son, Tion the Red, were killed during Tywin's attack on Tarbeck Hall. After the siege was done, Tywin had Tarbeck Hall burned to the ground. According to a semi-canon source, his daughters Rohanne and Cyrelle were forced to join the [[silent sisters]]. Rohanne's three-year-old son, the so-called last Lord Tarbeck, disappeared during the battle. Some rumours claim the boy escaped to [[Essos]], but the current school of thought is that he was murdered by Ser [[Amory Lorch]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarbeck, Walderan}}\n[[de:Walderan Tarbeck]]\n[[es:Walderan Tarbeck]]\n[[fr:Walderan Tarbeck]]\n[[nl:Walderan Teerbeek]]\n[[pl:Walderan Tarbeck]]\n[[ru:\u0423\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043a]]\n[[zh:\u74e6\u5fb7\u4f26\u00b7\u5854\u8d1d\u514b]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tarbeck]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

The lord, who was angered, accused Pypar of stealing silverware and he was then arrested and sentenced join the [[Night's Watch]], eventually arriving to [[Castle Black]]. Embarrassed, Pypar usually lies and tells people that the reason he was arrested was for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister, who had not eaten for three days (it isn't clear if he really even has a sister).<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/nightswatch/pyp/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, Night's Watch - Pyp entry]</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Jon, Sam and Pyp.jpg|thumb|Sam is introduced to Pyp, Jon and Grenn.]]Pypar, along with [[Grenn]] and [[Rast]], is beaten bloody by [[Jon Snow]] in the training yard at Castle Black. They later threaten Jon in the armory, but are dissuaded by [[Tyrion Lannister]]. Tyrion contrasts Pypar's background as a starving peasant to Jon's privileged upbringing in a warm castle with a master-at-arms eager to teach him in the art of combat. This encourages Jon to start training the others in swordplay, earning their respect.<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref>\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Pypar and Grenn have become firm friends, with Pypar teasing Grenn about his slow wits. When [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]] joins the recruits and is beaten, Pypar holds Jon back as he attempts to interfere. He goes along with Jon Snow's plan to 'go easy' on the new recruit, annoying their Master-at-Arms Ser [[Alliser Thorne]].<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\nPypar, Jon and Samwell are assigned to the stewards while Grenn is assigned to the rangers. Jon is upset that he has not gotten his desired appointment to the rangers. Pypar is annoyed by Jon's sense of entitlement and awkwardly tells Jon and Samwell that he was really sent to the Wall when as a singer at a nobleman's hall he refused to grant sexual favors to a noble lord. He didn't want to tell strangers the real reason. Samwell asks Pypar, who has a good singing voice, for a song, but Pypar is too embarrassed by his confession and walks off.<ref>\"[[You Win or You Die]]\"</ref>\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Pypar and [[Grenn]] are among the men who witness the arrival of the bodies of [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]] to [[Castle Black]].<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Jon and Pypar 1x10.png|thumb|Pyp convinces Jon to return to Castle Black.]]The dead men return as wights and Jon saves the Lord Commander from one of them.

The meeting is interrupted by a single horn blast, which is revealed to be the return of Grenn and Edd, who have managed to escape the chaos that occurred at Craster's Keep.<ref>\"[[Breaker of Chains]]\"</ref> Later, Pyp is present in the dining hall when Jon Snow asks for volunteers to deal with the mutineers who are holed up at Craster's Keep.<ref>\"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:S04E8_-_Night's_Watch_gang.png|thumb|Pyp discusses the wildling threat.]] \nThe news of the wildling attack on [[Mole's Town]] reaches Castle Black. Sam is horrified by the news, believing he has sent [[Gilly]] and [[Sam|her baby]] to their deaths. Pyp reminds Sam that he believed that everyone who went with Commander Mormont had died. Despite the odds, Jon, Sam, Grenn, and Edd all made it back to Castle Black alive, surviving both wildlings and wights during the [[Great Ranging]].<ref>\"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:PypDead.PNG|thumb|Pypar dies at the hands of Ygritte.]]\nAs he is preparing for the attack on Castle Black, he starts shaking, and Sam comes over to comfort and empower him to conduct his duties. As Mance Rayder's army attacks Castle Black, Pypar defends the bridge with a crossbow but continually missed killing members of their army before retreating with Sam. Pypar and Sam get to cover, and continue to try to kill the members of Mance Rayder's army. When Pypar successfully kills a wildling, he gushes over this achievement with Sam telling him he has more to do. As he goes to shoot again, [[Ygritte]] shoots an arrow at Pyp, mortally wounding him. As Pyp struggles and chokes on his own blood, Sam cradles him before he dies, promising him that Aemon will come.<ref>\"[[The Watchers on the Wall]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:PypBody.PNG|thumb|Pyp's body is burned with the other fallen brothers.]]\nAfter the arrival of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and his forces, Pypar is among the numerous bodies of fallen black brothers burned in Castle Black's courtyard.<ref>\"[[The Children]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nAt [[Winterfell]], Sam converses with Jon and Dolorous Edd, reminiscing about their first days as members of the Watch, with Grenn and Pyp.<ref>\"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|||yes|yes|||yes|yes|yes|yes}} \n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances||||||||||yes}} \n{{GoT/Season 4 appearances|||yes|yes|||yes|yes|yes|yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"165\" spacing=\"small\" columns=\"3\" orientation=\"square\">\nPypar 1x03.jpg\nPypS3.png|Pyp and Sam welcoming Jon when he arrives at Castle Black in \"[[Mhysa]]\".\nPypS4.PNG|Pyp discusses with Jon, Grenn, Sam and Eddison in \"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]\".\nS04E09_-_Pypar's_death.png|Pyp dying as Sam comforts him during the battle for Castle Black in \"[[The Watchers on the Wall]]\".\nPyp promo.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Quotes==\n{{Quote|How do one hundred and two men stop one hundred thousand?|Pypar|The Mountain and the Viper}}\n\n{{Quote|If you're afraid of a band of [[Free Folk|wildlings]], how in the seven hells did you kill a [[White Walker (Valar Morghulis)|White Walker]]?|Pypar to [[Samwell Tarly]].|The Watchers on the Wall}}\n\n{{Quote|I've never heard you curse before.|Pypar to [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] after he roars at him to let [[Gilly]] into [[Castle Black]].|The Watchers on the Wall}}\n\n{{dialogue a-b-a-b|Pypar|I got one!

He can imitate other people's voices and boasts that he can identify where in Westeros someone has come from just by their accent. He is named to the rangers. [[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that he is a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'', in which main character Frodo Baggins's best friend is Samwise Gamgee, called Sam for short. Similarly, [[Jon Snow]]'s best friend [[Samwell Tarly]] (also called \"Sam\" for short) is also an overweight, not martially skilled everyman character who enjoys reading stories in books. Moreover, Pypar (called Pyp) for short, has a similar name to Frodo's other companion Pippin Took (sometimes shortened to \"Pip\"). Thus both Jon Snow and Frodo Baggins have two companions named \"Sam and Pyp\".\n\nWhile the ranging force travels beyond the Wall, Pyp remains at [[Castle Black]]. He takes part in the [[Battle of Castle Black]].\n\nDespite Pyp and Grenn dying in the TV series, so far the two are still alive and well in the books.\n\nIn the fifth novel, Jon assigns Pyp to serve at [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]].\n\nThe show scene where Sam holds Pyp's head in his last moments is maybe based on the book scene in which Sam comforts the fatally-injured [[Jeor Mormont]] during the [[mutiny at Craster's Keep]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}} {{Watch navbox}}\n\n[[de:Pypar]]\n[[fr:Pypar]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0440]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Stewards of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Casualties of the conflict beyond the Wall]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

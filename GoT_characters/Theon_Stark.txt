A warning to other would-be conquerors.|[[Sansa Stark]]|Northern Allegiances to House Stark}}\nKing '''Theon Stark '''was [[King in the North]] during the [[Andal Invasion]] of [[Westeros]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Andal Invasion]], the unified northern lords under [[House Stark]] were able to keep them out, and King Theon sailed his own fleet to the Andal homeland [[Andalos]] for vengeance. There, he killed hundreds of Andal warriors, and upon returning home, he placed their heads on spikes along the northern coasts as a warning to anyone attempting to conquer the North.<ref>\"[[Northern Allegiances to House Stark]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, King Theon is depicted in the crypt of Winterfell as gaunt with long hair and a skinny appearance. His appearance as well as the constant state of war during his reign earned him the nickname, the Hungry Wolf. With the aid of [[House Bolton]], he defeated the Andal warlord Argos Sevenstar at the Battle of the Weeping Water. He then sailed across the Narrow Sea with Argos's body displayed on the prow of his ship like a figurehead and burned a score of Andal villages, killing hundreds and displaying the spiked heads of his slain enemies along his coastline to discourage future invaders.\n\nWhen Harrag Hoare, [[King of the Iron Islands]], invaded the western coast of the North during Theon's reign, he conquered the [[Stony Shore]] and burned the [[Wolfswood]]. His son, Ravos \"the Reaper\" Hoare, took Bear Island but Theon eventually slew him and expelled the [[ironborn]] as well.\n\nAt one point in ''A Dance with Dragons'', Theon Greyjoy refers to Theon Stark as his namesake.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stark, Theon}}\n\n[[de:Theon Stark]]\n[[es:Theon Stark]]\n[[nl:Theon Stark]]\n[[zh:\u5e2d\u6069\u00b7\u53f2\u5854\u514b]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0435\u043e\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Kings in the North]]\n[[Category:Members of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

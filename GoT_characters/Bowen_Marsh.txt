He is in charge of the day-to-day running of the Night's Watch, dealing with issues of supplies, funding, logistics and communications. He hails from [[House Marsh]], a noble [[crannogmen]] family of the [[Neck]] sworn to [[House Reed]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nAfter the assignment ceremony, [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] orders [[Pypar|Pyp]] to report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.<ref>\"[[You Win or You Die]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\n[[File:JonSnowS5E3.jpg|thumb|Bowen sits beside Lord Commander Snow.]]\nMarsh is present when [[Mance Rayder]] is executed by [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] for refusing to bend the knee.<ref>\"[[The Wars to Come]]\"</ref> Later, he participates in the [[Choosing]] of the 998th [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]].

[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] cites the [[Gift]] as a good place for the wildlings to settle because much of the farmland there is deserted, but Marsh reminds him that this is because the wildlings frequently targeted the lands of the Gift in their raids of the North, citing [[Olly]]'s village as an example.<ref>\"[[Kill the Boy]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen Jon returns from [[Hardhome]] with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Marsh is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust.<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n[[File:Bowen Marsh stabs Jon.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Bowen Marsh stabs Jon during the mutiny at Castle Black.]]\nMarsh later takes part in and helps organize a mutiny against Jon, as many Black brothers feel that he has forsaked the Night's Watch for the wildlings. After tricking Jon into being trapped in a corner, Marsh is the third to stab Jon, after Alliser Thorne and Othell Yarwyck, though he looks somewhat remorseful while uttering \"For the Watch\". He and the mutineers then leave Jon for dead as the sun rises.<ref>\"[[Mother's Mercy]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nThorne openly admits that he orchestrated Jon's murder, and Marsh was one of the conspirators.

With the Night's Watch outnumbered, Edd orders the mutineers arrested for their treachery. Marsh is subsequently dragged off and locked in an ice cell.<ref>\"[[Home]]\"</ref> Following Jon's resurrection, Marsh and the mutineers are sentenced to execution by hanging for their treason. He openly tells Jon that he shouldn't be alive, while Jon counters that the mutineers shouldn't have killed him.

It's not right!|Jon Snow|Neither was killing me.|Bowen Marsh's final words before being hanged by Jon Snow for [[treason]].|Oathbreaker}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDuring the first season it was believed [[Brian Fortune]] was playing Marsh, and [[Dennis McKeever]] was playing [[Othell Yarwyck]], based on comments made by Fortune and McKeever's character delivering one of Yarwyck's lines from the books. However, this assumption was then dispelled: McKeever reappeared in Seasons [[Game of Thrones Season 2|2]] and [[Game of Thrones Season 3|3]] in the [[Great Ranging]], even though Yarwyck didn't participate in the books; in [[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]], Fortune's character was identified as Yarwyck; and [[Michael Condron]] was subsequently cast as Marsh for the fifth season, which means Fortune's character was always Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing [[Night's Watch officer (You Win or You Die)|an unnamed Night's Watch officer]].\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bowen Marsh first appears in the first book, ''A Game of Thrones''. He is described as being red and round, leading [[Eddison Tollett|Dolorous Edd]] to nickname him \"the Old Pomegranate\". He is is an important senior figure in the Watch, reporting directly to Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] and is just below him in the command hierarchy of the Watch.\n\nDolorous Edd, Mance Rayder and Cotter Pyke have the same opinion about Marsh: that he is more skilled in counting than fighting.\n\nWhen Mormont and the rest of the Night's Watch ride out to investigate the wildling menace in the so-called \"[[Great Ranging]]\", he remains in command at Castle Black. Though not explicitly stated, Bowen Marsh hails from House Marsh, a noble house from the Neck sworn to House Reed.\n\nIn ''A Storm of Swords'', as the wildlings advance to Castle Black, Mance Rayder sends raiding parties to attack several areas of the Wall, in order to draw attention away from the main host and to split the defenders. Unfortunately, Marsh falls for the trick and takes most of the garrison from Castle Black. When Jon returns, he finds that only forty-one men are left in the castle, most of them old, crippled, or inexperienced.\n\nIn the novels, Marsh is initially friendly with Jon. In ''A Dance with Dragons'', he staunchly supports Jon when he is elected as the new Lord Commander, but slowly becomes disillusioned with him when he proposes an alliance with the wildlings, personally reminding him that what he is proposing is nothing less than treason towards the Watch. He also against attempting to save the wildlings at Hardhome.\n\nWhen Jon decides to leave Castle Black to seek out and kill [[Ramsay Bolton]], who apparently sent Jon [[Bastard Letter#In the books|a threatening letter]], it is Marsh who instigates the mutiny against Jon instead of Alliser Thorne (who is not present, since Jon sent him earlier on a mission beyond the Wall, and has not returned yet). He is the second to stab Jon, exclaiming \"''For the Watch''\" with tears in his eyes.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marsh, Bowen}}\n\n[[pt-br:Bowen Marsh]]\n[[de:Bowen Marsh]]\n[[es:Bowen Marsh]]\n[[pl:Bowen Marsh]]\n[[nl:Bouwen Mars]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u043e\u0443\u044d\u043d \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448]]\n[[zh:\u6ce2\u6587\u00b7\u9a6c\u5c14\u9521]]\n[[Category:Crannogmen|Marsh, Bowen]]\n[[Category:Stewards of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:House Marsh|Bowen Marsh]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Her mother is the captain of the ''Feathered Kiss''.\n\nSarella has her mother's looks of dark brown skin, curly black hair, and black eyes, though like all the Sand Snakes she has her father's widow's peak and the same shape to her eyes.\n\nSarella is nearly twenty years old, and has a reputation for insatiable curiosity and ''\"pushing in where she didn't belong\"''. While [[Obara Sand|Obara]] and [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] inherited their father's martial prowess, and [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]] his skill with poisons, Sarella inherited his keen intellect.\n\nSarella is the only Sand Snake who has not yet appeared or gotten involved in the recent Dornish affairs, either in the novels or the released sample chapters, only briefly mentioned. After [[Doran Martell|Doran]] hears what Obara, Nymeria and Tyene have in mind to avenge their father, he says that he hopes Sarella shows more common sense than her sisters. Currently she is outside of Dorne (it is not revealed where exactly), hence she is the only of the Sand Snakes who is not arrested, nor does she take any part in the missions that Doran assigns her elder sisters and her cousin Arianne to.\n\nIn the fourth novel, [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] meets at the [[Citadel]] a novice who introduces himself as Alleras aka the Sphinx, claiming that his father is Dornish and his mother is a Summer Islander trader. There is a fan theory that Alleras is in fact Sarella in disguise, since his name is Sarella spelled backwards, and based on what he tells about himself. If the theory is correct, it is unknown why Sarella is in [[Oldtown]] - whether she intends to become a maester (which is plausible in view of her thirst for knowledge), or is disguised as a part of a plan she has in store for settling the score with the Lannisters.\n\nSarella hasn't been identified by name in the TV series, though Oberyn did mention that he had eight daughters, just as in the novels, which indicates that she probably also \"exists\" in the TV continuity, even if she has not yet been featured.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sand, Sarella}}\n[[de:Sarella Sand]]\n[[es:Sarella Arena]]\n[[nl:Sarella Zand]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0421\u044d\u043d\u0434]]\n[[pl:Sarella Sand]]\n[[pt-br:Sarella Sand]]\n[[zh:\u4f0a\u8389\u4e9a\u00b7\u6c99\u5fb7]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Desperate to cement his stolen throne with an heir, Maegor took three wives at once, known as the Black Brides because each were women he'd widowed in his wars. All three women grew full with child in time, but each gave birth to the same twisted monstrosities as his second wife. One need not be a maester, much less a Grand Maester, to deduce the common thread here. |[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel}}\nQueen '''Jeyne Westerling''' was a wife of [[Maegor Targaryen]], one of the three \"[[Black Brides]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nKing Maegor married Jeyne out of desperation for an heir, after failing to produce one with his first three wives, choosing her because she was of proven fertility. Her late husband was at some point killed by Maegor. However, she still miscarried just like the others.<ref>\"[[Maegor the Cruel]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Jeyne's husband Alyn Tarbeck died during the [[Battle Beneath the Gods Eye]] in 43 AC. She gave birth to his posthumous son a few months later. In 47 AC, Jeyne was forced to marry Maegor Targaryen along with [[Elinor Costayne]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena Targaryen]]. Jeyne's son was present as a hostage for her compliance. He became the [[Lord of Tarbeck Hall]] after the wedding, and was sent to [[Casterly Rock]] to be raised as a [[ward]] of Lord Lyman Lannister.\n\nBoth Jeyne and Elinor became pregnant the same year, and Maegor happily showered them with gifts and honors, and granted lands and titles to their families. However, Jeyne gave birth three months early to a stillborn child, lacking arms and legs and possessing both male and female genitalia. Jeyne herself died soon after; she was the third to die of Maegor's six wives. In 48 AC, [[Tyanna of the Tower]] confessed to having poisoned Jeyne's child in the womb.\n\nOf the three Black Brides, only Jeyne is mentioned in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels: when [[Catelyn Stark]] chides [[Robb Stark|her son]] for breaching the pact with [[House Frey]] by marrying [[Talisa Stark#in the books|Jeyne Westerling]], he says that the Westerlings are better blood than the Freys, and there was another Jeyne Westerling who was queen to King Maegor. Unimpressed, Catelyn sharply points out that will only salt [[Walder Frey|Lord Walder]]'s wounds.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF|Jeyne Westerling (wife of Maegor I)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Westerling, Jeyne}}\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:House Westerling]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tarbeck]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043d \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0433]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

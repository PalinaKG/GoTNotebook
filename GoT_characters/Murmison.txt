The [[Faith Militant]] and the clergy of the [[Faith of the Seven]] objected to this [[Incest|incestuous]] union, and rebelled against the crown, leading to the [[Faith Militant uprising]].\n\nMurmison himself was seized by the [[Faith Militant]] for his role in the marriage, scourged with whips, and killed.<ref>\"[[The Faith Militant]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\n\nThe video featurette on the Faith Militant uprising seems to imply that the Faith Militant simply scourged Murmison with whips - actually, the Faith Militant dragged Murmison from his palanquin as he was being carried through the city, and tore him to pieces.\n\nMurmison was a reputed miracle worker, and Aenys even appointed him [[Hand of the King]] in an attempt to placate the Faith of the Seven - though this did not succeed, and anyone should have known that aiding Aenys's foolish decision to have his own children marry would anger the Faith into open revolt. Murmison is therefore remembered as one of the worst Hands ever, and by the end the realm was praying for his demise.\n\nWhen Aenys first took the throne he retained his father's last Hand of the King, Alyn Stokeworth, but he died in one of the localized rebellions that broke out after his coronation; Maegor quickly succeeded in crushing a different rebellion, so Aenys happily named his half-brother as his new Hand. Maegor served as Hand for another two years or so and for a time all seemed well, but Maegor increasingly grew frustrated that he could produce no children with his first wife, Cerse Hightower - nor could he get an annulment, because she was the High Septon's own niece. As Aenys and his own wife kept producing more healthy children, driving Maegor even further back in line of succession, he could bare it no longer, and polygamously took a second wife, Alys Harroway. The Faith was also upset with the Targaryens' past history of polygamous marriages, not to mention the personal insult to her uncle the High Septon. Even the politically unskilled Aenys realized he had to do something, so he had Maegor exiled to the Free Cities and named Septon Murmison as his new Hand. This at least kept the Faith from openly revolting for a time - until Aenys grew so aloof and prideful that he stupidly decided to marry his eldest son and daughter to each other. Murmison was expelled from the Faith for performing the marriage, and within a fortnight he was killed in the streets by the Faith Militant.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d]]\n[[pt-br:Murmison]]\n[[Category:Septons]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

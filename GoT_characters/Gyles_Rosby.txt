He's noted for being sickly and constantly coughing.\n\nLord Gyles is at many major events including the tourney on King Joffrey's [[Nameday]], [[riot of King's Landing]], Sansa and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s wedding, the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], the procession greeting [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s funeral. Cersei appointed him [[Master of Coin]] after Tyrion is put on trial for Joffrey's murder. Cersei considers him adequate in the position, but hounding over the crown's debt problems by the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]]' envoy exasperates his sickness and he perishes at the Red Keep. [[Pycelle]] protests that he did all he could, but an irate and paranoid Cersei accuses him of conspiring with [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] to kill Lord Gyles, in order to create a vacancy in the Small Council that would be taken by any of the Tyrells or their bannermen. She orders Pycelle to have all Lord Gyles's lands and wealth go to Tommen rather than his ward. Cersei selects Ser [[Harys Swyft]] as the new Master of Coin.\n\nAccording to the semi-canonical ''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying Campaign Guide: A Game of Thrones Edition'' from [[wikipedia:Green Ronin Publishing|Green Ronin Publishing]] Lord Gyles is the father of Lord [[Walder Frey]]'s sixth wife Bethany Rosby and grandfather of Robb Stark's former squire [[Olyvar Frey]] and Lord [[Edmure Tully]]'s wife [[Roslin Tully|Roslin Frey]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rosby, Gyles}}\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0441 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0431\u0438]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:House Rosby|Gyles]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

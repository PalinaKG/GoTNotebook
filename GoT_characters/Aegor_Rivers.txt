The Golden Company was born. For their words they chose \"Beneath the gold, the bitter steel\" to remind themselves that they weren't just hired killers, but knights of Westeros who would one day retake their home.|[[Jorah Mormont]]|The Golden Company}}\n'''Aegor Rivers''', also known as '''Bittersteel''', was one of the infamous [[Great Bastards]] of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], also known as \"Aegon the Unworthy\". He was the founder of the [[Golden Company]], a [[Mercenary|sellsword company]] in [[Essos]] composed primarily of [[Westeros]]i exiles.\n\n==Biography==\nAegor Rivers was born of [[bastardy]] to King Aegon the Unworthy, being considered one of the ''Great Bastards''. When [[Daemon I Blackfyre|Daemon Blackfyre]], his brother, rose in [[Blackfyre Rebellion|rebellion]] against the [[Iron Throne]], Aegor supported the [[House Blackfyre|rebels]]. When the Blackfyres lost the war with the death of the pretender king Daemon on the battlefield, Aegor fled into Essos with the remaining Blackfyre forces.\n\nAegor, now calling himself \"Bittersteel\" and fashioning for himself a personal sigil (a red horse with black wings on a golden field), founded the Golden Company to fund another war against the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. The sellsword company, to remind themselves that they are not just sellswords but [[Knighthood|knights]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] who will one day retake their home, chose \"Beneath the gold, the bitter steel!\" for their battle cry.<ref>\"[[The Golden Company]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nAegor, along with his siblings is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree Regency Conquest of Dorne era}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBittersteel the Blackfyres.png|Aegor, with a shield depicting his own personal sigil, as shown in \"[[The Blackfyres]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aegor Rivers was often called \"Bittersteel\". While King Aegon IV had many bastard children, the mothers of four of them were also noblewomen, which encouraged him to formally acknowledge them. The four Great Bastards were [[Daemon I Blackfyre]] (whose mother, secretly, was [[Daena Targaryen]]), Aegor \"Bittersteel\" Rivers (whose mother was a member of [[House Bracken]]), [[Brynden Rivers|Brynden \"Bloodraven\" Rivers]] (whose mother was a member of [[House Blackwood]]), and [[Shiera Seastar]] (whose mother was Serenei of [[Lys]], from an ancient Valyrian noble family).\n\nOn his deathbed, Aegon IV foolishly (and perhaps spitefully) had them all [[Legitimization|legitimized]], which led to strife between them and his legitimate heir King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]], tensions which ultimately split the realm apart in the devastating civil war known as the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].\n\nBittersteel sided with his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre, while his other half-brother Bloodraven sided with their half-brother King Daeron II Targaryen. Bittersteel and Bloodraven hated each other, because they both competed for the love of their half-sister Shiera Seastar. Bloodraven asked her to marry him dozens of times and she refused, but she did let him into her bed - though she had many lovers. Shiera, however, completely rejected Bittersteel, and for this he never forgave Bloodraven. It also didn't help that Bittersteel's mother was a Bracken and Bloodraven's mother was a Blackwood, as those two noble families had been feuding for thousands of years. Bittersteel became a great champion and general for the Blackfyres, while Bloodraven became a great champion and general for the Targaryens.\n\nThe First Blackfyre Rebellion ended with the [[Battle of the Redgrass Field]], in which Daemon Blackfyre and his eldest two sons were slain. Bittersteel survived, and became one of the major leaders of the surviving Blackfyre forces as they fled into exile in the [[Free Cities]]. Daemon left behind five sons and multiple daughters, so Bittersteel became their guardian, secreting them across the [[Narrow Sea]] with his dwindling followers.\n\nWhile in the Free Cities, many of Bittersteel's remaining men deserted to join [[Mercenary|mercenary companies]]. In response, Bittersteel resorted to forming his remaining soldiers into their ''own'' mercenary company, called the [[Golden Company]]. Day by day and year by year they fought in the petty wars between the different Free Cities in order to make enough money for their basic upkeep. This step at least ensured that the Blackfyre Pretenders would have some semblance of a stable core fighting force whenever they mounted a new plot to invade Westeros. In time, the Golden Company became the largest and most skilled mercenary company in the Free Cities.\n\nFrom the Free Cities, Bittersteel continued to plot new invasions of the Seven Kingdoms for at least forty years. After the first (and greatest) rebellion failed in 196 AC, he took no part in the Second Blackfyre Rebellion in 212 AC - which was more of a failed plot than an actual war - which was instigated by [[Daemon II Blackfyre]]. Afterwards, Bloodraven imprisoned Daemon II but kept him alive, to discourage Bittersteel from crowning Daemon II's younger brother Haegon as the new head of House Blackfyre. Bittersteel was briefly taken captive after the failure of the Third Blackfyre Rebellion, and brought to the Red Keep in chains. He was found guilty of high treason, and while [[Brynden Rivers|Bloodraven]] and [[Aerion Targaryen|Prince Aerion]] urged King [[Aerys I Targaryen]] to execute Bittersteel, Aerys instead chose to send him to the [[Wall]]; however, Aegor's allies captured the ship transporting him to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] and freed him to return to Essos. Eventually, Bittersteel even took part in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion in the year 236 AC, in which the Golden Company crossed the Narrow Sea and landed on Massey's Hook (in the southeastern Crownlands, near the border with the northern Stormlands). By this time, however, they had very little support. Daemon III Blackfyre was personally killed by Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] in battle and the rebellion ended.\n\nBittersteel eventually died and ordered the other members of the Golden Company to preserve his skull in gold. Subsequent commanders of the Company have followed his example.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivers, Aegor}}\n[[de:Aegor Strom]]\n[[es:Aegor R\u00edos]]\n[[fr:Aegor Rivers]]\n[[pl:Aegor Rivers]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0439\u0433\u043e\u0440 \u0420\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Legitimized bastards]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of the Golden Company]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

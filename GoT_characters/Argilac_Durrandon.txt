Then sent an envoy to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], asking Aegon for his armies and his dragons, which in return he would give lands owned by Harren and a wife in his daughter, [[Argella Baratheon|Argella]]. However, Aegon had already married his two sisters, [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]].\n\nUpon receiving the envoy, Aegon sent his own to demand Argilac wed Argella to his rumored half-brother, [[Orys Baratheon]]. Argilac answered with a box filled with the hands of the envoy and a letter announcing: \"''These are the only hands your\u00a0[[bastard]]\u00a0shall have of me!\" ''As Aegon had been waiting for an excuse to use his armies and force on Westeros, he sent his army by ship to [[Storm's End]], then sending ravens to all [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Aegon then strategically placed himself between the [[Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers]] and the [[Kingdom of the Stormlands]], so that Argilac and Harren could not decide on who should take action against him.\n\nHe sent his commander and rumored half-brother, Orys Baratheon, to take the ancestral stronghold of the Storm Kings. Argilac met Orys's forces in open battle and was soundly defeated. Afterward, Orys took not only Storm's End and the Stormlands, but also Argilac's black stag sigil, his words - \"Ours is the Fury\" - and his daughter, becoming the first Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and the founder of House Baratheon.<ref>\"The Complete Guide to Westeros: House Baratheon\" featurette, Season 1 Blu Ray boxset</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Durrandon}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Argilac was the leader of House Durrandon, the rulers of the Stormlands for centuries. After his death, Orys Baratheon took the sigil and words of House Durrandon as those of House Baratheon.\n\nArgilac got his nickname for arrogantly refusing Aegon's offer of marrying Orys (a bastard) to his daughter, cutting off the hands of Aegon's envoy and sending them back to him. He was also arrogant in engaging the Targaryens in open battle rather than withstanding a siege in the infamously impregnable castle of Storm's End. However, Argilac was motivated in this by having heard of the death of [[Harren Hoare]] in similar circumstances at [[Harrenhal]], who prepared for a siege in his immense castle only for the Targaryen dragons to fly right over the walls. If Argilac resisted a siege by Orys it would only be a matter of time until the Targaryens directed their dragons to the castle, so wishing to avoid this fate Argilac met Orys in pitched battle.\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Durrandon, Argilac}}\n\n[[de:Argilac Durrandon]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0434\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439]]\n[[Category:Members of House Durrandon]]\n[[Category:Storm Kings]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

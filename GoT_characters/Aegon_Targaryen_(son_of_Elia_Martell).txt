Then I smashed her head... in like this!\" He then crushes Oberyn's skull, effectively confirming the long-standing rumor of arguably his most infamous war crime.<ref>\"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nThe deaths of Aegon, his mother and sister are finally avenged by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], as he kills (and gets killed by) the Mountain.<ref>\"[[The Bells]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n===Paternal===\n{{House Targaryen family tree}}\n===Maternal===\n{{House Martell family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aegon is the infant son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell. He was ''allegedly'' killed by Gregor Clegane bashing his head in against a wall - then while still covered in the gore of the baby's blood and brains, Gregor raped Aegon's mother and killed her (some say he cut her in half with his sword). In the books, Amory Lorch separately killed Aegon's sister Rhaenys, but the TV series condensed this with Gregor killing both.\n\nOne of the visions Daenerys sees in the [[House of the Undying]] is of her brother Rhaegar, his wife and a baby: Rhaegar decides on the name \"Aegon\" for his newborn son, as he thinks the name fit for a king; Elia asks whether Rhaegar will make a song for their son, and he replies that Aegon, the prince that was promised, already has the song of ice and fire. Rhaegar then says enigmatically that there must be \"one more\", since \"''the dragon has three heads''.\"\n\nLater, Daenerys tells [[Jorah Mormont]] about her vision. Jorah confirms that the people she saw matched the description of Rhaegar and Elia, and the baby was their heir Aegon; he comments that if Aegon was \"the prince that was promised\", then the promise was broken when he was killed.\n\nIn the fifth novel, Daenerys muses about Aegon, who would have been the sixth of his name to sit on the Iron Throne. She believes that, had Aegon lived, she might have married him, as he would have been closer to her in age than Viserys.\n\nUnbeknownst to Daenerys, Aegon is alive: Varys switched him with another baby (the one whom the Mountain killed), smuggled him across the narrow sea, and entrusted him to [[Illyrio Mopatis]]. Currently, he is in the custody of [[Jon Connington]], who is determined to do everything in his power to make Aegon ascend the Iron Throne.\n\n[[Quaithe]] enigmatically warns Daenerys of several people, among them the \"griffin\" and the \"mummer's dragon\"; Daenerys has no idea who are these people, but to the readers it is obvious Quaithe refers to Connington and Aegon respectively. In contrast to the other people mentioned in Quaithe's obscure prophecy ([[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], Quentyn Martell, Victarion Greyjoy and the Red Priest Moqorro), Aegon and Connington do not get involved in the current events at [[Slaver's Bay]].\n\nAccording to [[Varys]], Aegon has been shaped for rule before he could walk; he has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be; he has been taught to read and write and to speak several languages; he has studied history and law and poetry; a septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith; he has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need; he can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. While [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] has been taught that kingship is his ''right'', Aegon knows kingship is his ''duty'', that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.\n\nWhen Aegon makes his first appearance in the books (before his true identity is revealed to the readers), he is described as a handsome, lithe and well-made youth, with a lanky build and a shock of dark blue hair (his hair is dyed as a part of his disguise) and dark blue eyes, about fifteen or sixteen years old.<ref>Actually, Aegon is 18 years old when introduced, since he was born in 282 AC.</ref>\n\nAegon is not a POV character. His actions are witnessed and interpreted through the POV of Tyrion (till he is kidnapped by Jorah Mormont) and Connington.\n\nTyrion travels for a while with Aegon, Connington and their servants. They introduce themselves as Griff and his son, but Tyrion soon figures out their true identities. While Connington acts hostilely toward Tyrion, Aegon befriends him.\n\nAegon is certain that once he meets Daenerys, she will marry him and give him her armies and dragons, then they will travel to Westeros and conquer it; he sees nothing wrong of the idea of marrying his aunt, according to the Targaryens' custom of marrying their kin (in sharp contrast to Jon Snow, who keeps distance from Daenerys once he is told about his true identity in the show). Hearing that, Tyrion scoffs at Aegon; he explains to the overconfident youth that his aunt is not some timid little girl who does whatever she is told, but a powerful queen, who has crossed deserts, survived assassins, rallied armies and conquered cities. Tyrion concludes that if Aegon appears before her like that (even with the [[Golden Company]]), he'll look like a beggar; he advises Aegon to travel to Westeros instead, raise his banners, rally supporters, and then Daenerys will come and meet him as equals. \n\nWhen Aegon and Connington arrive at Volantis (without Tyrion, who has been kidnapped by Jorah at [[Selhorys]]) and join the Golden Company, they find out that Daenerys is still in Meereen, and due to the [[Second Siege of Meereen|siege]] - they cannot reach her. Whether Aegon is aware or not of the severity of his aunt's predicament, he does not intend to assist her. He suggests what Tyrion advised him earlier - that they should sail to Westeros instead; nearly all the officers agree. [[Harry Strickland]], coward and hesitant as ever, objects, but no one listen to him.\n\nSoon after Aegon and Connington arrive at Westeros, the Golden Company seizes [[Griffin's Roost]] and several more castles in the Stormlands; Connington's next target is [[Storm's End]]. Aegon, who starts acting arrogantly since his arrival at Westeros, announces that he wants to lead the attack on Storm's End.\n\nConnington starts rallying supporters and allies; first of all, he sends a letter to [[Doran Martell]], informing him that his presumed-dead nephew is alive, and offering an alliance. Doran, cautious as ever, regards the contents of the letter dubiously; since he prefers not to act till he knows for a certainty what is happening, he sends his daughter Arianne to find out whether Aegon and Connington are really the people whom they claim to be.\n\nSoon, as Connington expected, news about the landing reach King's Landing. [[Mace Tyrell]] and [[Randyll Tarly]] regard the reports rather flippantly; even the report about the alleged fall of Storm's End does not worry them. [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], however, believes that Aegon and Connington (whether they are the people they claim to be or just pretenders) pose a serious threat, which must be dealt without delay, otherwise - as soon as Daenerys arrives at Westeros and joins forces with them, the Lannisters and their allies will not stand a chance.\n\nSince the marriage of Rhaegar and Elia has never been annulled (it is an invention of the TV show), Aegon has the strongest claim to the Iron Throne, according to the Westerosi inheritance laws.\n\nThere are fan speculations that the aforementioned youth who claims to be Aegon - is an impostor, whom Varys and Illyrio intend to use as a puppet king in order to gain power. According to these speculations, he could be a Blackfyre descendant, Illyrio's son, or just someone with the right age and look (in the [[Free Cities]], there are people who descend from Valyria, and have the Targaryen physical features).\n\nIt should be noted that Aegon's book character has not been merged with Jon's show character; Aegon is considered dead in the show.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Aegon}}\n\n[[de:Aegon Targaryen (Sohn von Elia Martell)]]\n[[fr:Aegon Targaryen]]\n[[pl:Aegon Targaryen (syn Rhaegara i Elii)]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0439\u0433\u043e\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d (\u0441\u044b\u043d \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430)]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

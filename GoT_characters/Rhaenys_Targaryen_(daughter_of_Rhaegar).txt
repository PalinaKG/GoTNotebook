You murdered her! You killed her children!\". However, Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard when the Mountain suddenly trips him up. Berserk with fury at nearly being killed by his opponent, the Mountain pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear, \"Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her!

[[Varys]] talks about her with the imprisoned [[Eddard Stark]] as an example of how the innocent suffer in times of uprising. She was three- or four-years-old when she died, and took after her mother in appearance with the classic Dornish features of black hair, dark eyes, and olive skin (much to the distaste of her paternal grandfather, who often made snide racist remarks about Rhaenys and her mother).\n\nRhaenys had a small black [[Cat|kitten]] she named \"[[Balerion]]\", after the mighty dragon of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. [[Varys]] commented about it sadly, \"Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her door.\" No one knows what happened to the cat after she died: it is implied that it survived the downfall of the Targaryens and lived out the next fifteen years in the Red Keep during the reign of Robert Baratheon. When [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is ordered by [[Syrio Forel]] to chase cats around the Red Keep to train her in agility (which occurs in the TV series in \"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\") one of the cats she encounters is an incredibly old black cat with a chewed ear, who is mean to the entire Baratheon household, as well as the Lannisters. Once, when Tywin was visiting the Red Keep for a feast, the black cat jumped onto the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Tywin's fingers. According to Cersei, that cat attacks ravens at the rookery, and once clawed Joffrey's hand. This may very well be Rhaenys's cat Balerion, angered at the new residents of the castle who are responsible for the death of his original owner. [[George R.R. Martin]] was asked whether the aforementioned cat is Rhaenys's; he answered evasively \"Could be\".<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Jeyne_Poole_and_the_Black_Cat/ So Spake Martin, November 14, 1999]</ref>\n\nAfter King's Landing was seized by the Lannister forces, Rhaenys was found by Ser [[Amory Lorch]] hiding under the bed of her father, Rhaegar. While Gregor killed her mother and brother, Lorch killed Rhaenys by stabbing her about fifty times. When Robert arrived in the capital her body was presented at his feet, and it looked nearly hacked to pieces. Even Tywin considered that deed overly brutal (not the murder itself, but the manner in which it was done). He asked Lorch why killing a two- or three-year-old girl required so many thrusts, and Lorch answered that she kicked him and would not stop screaming. Years later, when discussing the event with Tyrion, Tywin disdainfully comments that if Lorch had half the brain a turnip has, he would have calmed Rhaenys with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow to smother her.\n\nThe TV series simplified events so that Gregor Clegane killed both of Elia's children, without the involvement of Amory Lorch.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Rhaenys}}\n[[de:Rhaenys Targaryen (Tochter von Rhaegar)]]\n[[pl:Rhaenys Tagaryen (c\u00f3rka Rhaegara)]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d]]\n[[fr:Rhaenys Targaryen (fille de Rhaegar)]]\n[[no:Rhaenys Targaryen (datter av Rhaegar)]]\n[[es:Rhaenys Targaryen, hija de Rhaegar]]\n[[ro:Rhaenys Targaryen (fiica lui Rhaegar)]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

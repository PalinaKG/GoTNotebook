He formed an alliance with [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nShagga son of [[Dolf]] is the leader of the [[Stone Crows]], one of the [[Hill tribes]] who live in the foothills of the [[Mountains of the Moon]] on the western border of the [[Vale of Arryn]]. He is a notable warrior who holds fealty to no [[Lordship|lord]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Shagga-0.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Shagga meets with Tyrion Lannister.]]\nShagga leads the party of tribesmen which finds Tyrion and [[Bronn]] traveling out of the Vale into the [[Riverlands]]. Shagga intends to rob the travelers and take Tyrion captive as a fool. Tyrion offers an alliance between the hill tribes and [[House Lannister]] on the basis that they share mutual enemies, [[House Arryn]] and [[House Stark]], promising gold and weapons. Shagga agrees to the alliance and escorts Tyrion to the Lannister army camped in the Riverlands. The force is led by [[Tywin Lannister|Tyrion's father]]. They are joined by [[Timett]] of the [[Burned Men]] and [[Chella]] of the [[Black Ears]] along the way. There are also clansmen from the [[Moon Brothers]] and [[Painted Dogs]] in their group. Tywin accepts the alliance and Shagga's insistence that they fight alongside Tyrion on the battlefield.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\nTyrion reports to his father and his [[Kevan Lannister|uncle]] that while at camp, a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage, at which the Moon Brother was set upon by three Stone Crows who opened his throat. Bronn managed to restrain Shagga from cutting off the dead man's genitals - \"which was fortunate\" - but [[Ulf]] of the Moon Brothers demanded blood money from the Stone Crows, which Shagga and [[Gunthor]] refused to pay. Tywin criticized Tyrion for the lack of discipline in these new allies he had brought to their side.<ref name=\":0\">\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\nShagga demands two axes from the Lannister stores to [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]]'s chagrin. He and his men actually fight well at the [[Battle of the Green Fork]] and win a convincing victory over their foes. Tyrion fails to join them after he is accidentally knocked unconscious by his own men in the rush to the fight. Shagga and his troops join in the post-battle looting of the fallen bodies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=yes|9=yes}}\n\n==Quotes==\n{{dialogue a-b-a|Tyrion Lannister|I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.|Shagga|How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?|In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.|Tyrion uses his sense of humor to defuse Shagga.|The Pointy End}}\n{{dialogue a-b|Kevan Lannister|The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle-axes, heavy black steel, double-sided.|Tyrion Lannister|Shagga likes axes.|[[Kevan Lannister]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]] on '''Shagga'''|Baelor}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Shagga son of Dolf is a member of the Stone Crows, one of the mountain clans. He is described as a massive, slow and\u00a0strong\u00a0man, dressed all in skins, with a deep and deadly voice,\u00a0who prefers to wield two weapons in combat; according to Tyrion, he looks\u00a0like\u00a0[[Casterly Rock]] with hair. His favored taunt is to threaten to remove someone's manhood and feed it to \"the goats\" - even when there are no goats in the vicinity. He is not the most intelligent man, but is extremely dangerous in battle.\n\nShagga boasts that\u00a0whereas a Stone Crow's axe is always sharp - Shagga's axes are sharpest of all. On one occasion, he jokingly tells Tyrion that once he cut off a man's head, but that man did not know it until he tried to brush his hair, then it fell off.\n\nWhile\u00a0Tyrion and Bronn are on their way from\u00a0the\u00a0Vale\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Lannister camp, Bronn captures a goat for food, and then they are encountered by at least a dozen of\u00a0the Stone Crows clan, including\u00a0[[Gunthor|Gunthor son of Gurn]]\u00a0and Shagga;\u00a0Gunthor (in the show - Shagga)\u00a0claims\u00a0\"our mountain, our goat\".\u00a0Tyrion persuades them into joining him as depicted in the TV series.\n\nUnlike in the show, in the novels it is evident that Gunthor, not Shagga, is the leader of the Stone Crows. When Tyrion teases the Stone Crows about their cowardice, Shagga reacts aggressively, but Gunthor silences him and tells Tyrion to say what he has to offer.\u00a0\n\nShagga makes quite impressive entrance to the common room where Tyrion, Tywin and Kevan sit: he opens the door with a crash, startling Tyrion and Kevan; the captain of the guard goes flying across the room to smash against the hearth; Shagga snaps the man\u2019s sword in two over a knee thick as a tree trunk, and lumbers into the common room, threatening the man \"next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire\".\n\nShagga fights fiercely at the\u00a0[[Battle of the Green Fork]]; Tyrion\u00a0sees him catching a spearman full in the chest, his axe shearing through mail and leather and muscle and lungs. After killing his opponent, Shagga rides on, cleaving a shield in two with his left-hand battle-axe, while the corpse bounces and stumbles bonelessly along on his right, until the dead man finally slids off.\n\nAfter the battle, Tyrion finds Shagga\u00a0slumped beneath a tree, riddled with arrows, mourning his dead clan member Conn.\u00a0When Bronn pulls\u00a0him\u00a0to his feet, the big man seems\u00a0to notice the arrows for the first time;\u00a0he simply plucks\u00a0them out one by one, without bothering to ask for medical treatment.\n\nIn \"''A Clash of Kings''\", when Tyrion is sent to [[King's Landing]] to act as the [[Hand of the King]], Shagga is among the clansmen who escort and\u00a0serve\u00a0him\u00a0as bodyguards and enforcers.\n\nShagga and Timett accompany\u00a0Tyrion when he confronts Pycelle (Bronn is not present at that scene). Shagga is the one who\u00a0breaks the door open and cuts Pycelle's beard at Tyrion's command.\u00a0Tyrion leverages Shagga's imposing physical presence in his interrogation. Shagga wants Pycelle's bedmate to himself, but Tyrion forbids him to harm her, and has Timett take the frightened girl outside, to Shagga's disappointment.\n\nPrior to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Tyrion recognizes that the hill tribes, while ferocious, are undisciplined and\u00a0inexperienced at siege-warfare, so he sends them south across the river to the [[Kingswood]] to harass the scouts of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s army as they approached the city. They perform quite well, destroying Stannis's scouts and screening forces to such an extent that he has no warning of the approach of\u00a0Tywin's\u00a0massive reinforcements approaching the city.\n\nAfter the battle, Bronn informs Tyrion that most of\u00a0the hill tribes have returned home to the Mountains of the Moon in the Vale;\u00a0Shagga and the Stone Crows, however, decide to stay in the Kingswood, feeling that there are better opportunities for them there.\n\nWhile Tyrion is imprisoned, he considers sending [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] to look for Shagga, hoping that he'd agree be his champion in the trial by combat. Tyrion eventually dismisses the thought because there are so many hiding places in the deep of the Kingswood, and Pod has no tracking skills.\n\nShagga does not appear in the next novels. In the appendices of \"''A Feast for Crows''\" and \"''A Dance with Dragons''\" he is listed as the chief of the Stone Crows, presently leading a band in the kingswood,\u00a0while Gunthor is not mentioned.\n\nIn \"''A Dance with Dragons''\", when Tyrion, Jorah and their dwarf companion Penny arrive at the [[Second Sons]]' camp, Tyrion assures Ben Plumm that he can be very generous to his friends; he jokingly mentions Shagga (alongside Timett and Bronn) as a\u00a0referee.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Shagga]]\n[[ru:\u0428\u0430\u0433\u0433\u0430]]\n[[fr:Shagga]]\n[[zh:\u590f\u560e]]\n[[es:Shagga]]\n[[it:Shagga]]\n[[nl:Shagga]]\n[[Category:Hill tribes]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

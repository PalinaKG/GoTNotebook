Hoping to seek up on the dragon, Ser Byron was fatally mistaken and burnt to death. His death was written about in ''[[The Dance of Dragons, A True Telling]]'' by [[Grand Maester]] [[Munkun]].<ref name=\"S5EP09\" />\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\n[[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]] reads ''[[The Dance of Dragons, A True Telling]]'', sharing a laugh over Ser Byron's demise with  [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]].<ref name=\"S5EP09\" />\n}}\n\n==In the books==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is in [[Pentos]], he briefly assumes the false identity of Hugor Hill and is asked to prove he is truly a Westerosi, by naming a knight who tried to killed a dragon during the Dance of Dragons, imitating the famous legend of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield from the [[Age of Heroes]].\n\nNot only does Tyrion know it was Ser Byron Swann, but also notes that Grand Maester Munkun erred in his book - Byron didn't try to kill Vhagar, he tried to kill [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s dragon [[Syrax]]. As Tyrion explains, Byron was the son of a marcher lord, who was sworn to House Baratheon, who declared for King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. Moreover, Vhagar was ridden by Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]], King Aegon II's brother - so it really wouldn't make sense for Byron to try to kill Vhagar. Some time ago, Tyrion noticed the discrepancy in the course of his own studies, and even researched it further by obtaining a letter written by Ser Byron's squire - who witnessed Ser Byron's death - to the squire's daughter, and in the letter it was stated that Syrax killed him.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swann, Byron}}\n[[fr:Byron Swann]]\n[[de:Beyron Swann]]\n[[es:Byron Swann]]\n[[it:Byron Swann]]\n[[nl:Byron Swaan]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0430\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0421\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u62dc\u4f26\u00b7\u53f2\u6587]]\n[[Category:Knights|Swann, Byron]]\n[[Category:House Swann|Byron]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Greens]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

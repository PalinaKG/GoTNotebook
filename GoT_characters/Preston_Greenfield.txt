He is noted as the shortest member of the Kingsguard. He accompanied Robert on his boar hunting trip where [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|he was mortally wounded]]. He pledges allegiance to Joffrey following Robert's death.\n\nSimilarly to at least three other members of the Kingsguard (Jaime, [[Boros Blount]] and [[Arys Oakheart]]), Ser Preston used to violate his vow of celibacy at a certain draper's house whenever the draper was away.\n\nSer Preston is killed in the [[Riot of King's Landing]]; he has been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that he was red-brown from head to heel.\n\nSer Preston is replaced by Ser [[Balon Swann]], who has been mentioned in the series but not as part of the Kingsguard. In the series, no Kingsguard is shown to be killed by the rioters. Ser Preston is later mentioned as being alive at the time of Joffrey's wedding, meaning he survived the riots in TV continuity.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Kingsguard navbox}}\n{{King's Landing Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greenfield, Preston}}\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043b\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u666e\u5217\u65af\u987f\u00b7\u683c\u6797\u83f2\u5c14]]King\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Queensguard]]\n[[Category:Members of House Greenfield]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

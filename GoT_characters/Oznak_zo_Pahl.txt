He insults her and her [[Unsullied]] by urinating in their direction, mocking their status as eunuchs and accusing Daenerys of being a man who hides his genitals in his anus. Daenerys chooses [[Daario Naharis]], the least valuable of her party, to battle him. Daario Naharis defeats him by throwing a knife into the eye of Oznak's horse, causing it to fall and him with it. Pahl attempts to rise, but is quickly decapitated. Daario returns Pahl's gesture by urinating toward Meereen.<ref>\"[[Breaker of Chains]]\"</ref>\n\n== Appearance ==\n{{GoT/Season 4 appearances|||yes}}\n\n==Quotes==\n\n{{Quote|Byjan vavi demble eva o, trezy eme verdje espo jimi!

I blow my nose at you, ''so-called'' \"Dragon Queen\", you and all your silly Westerosi kaniggets!\"|Oznak zo Pahl to Daenerys, translated|Breaker of Chains}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nExecutive producer [[D.B. Weiss]] came up with the idea to have Oznak's untranslated taunting of Daenerys in Low Valyrian use the dialogue from the French Taunter scene in the film ''[[Wikipedia:Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Linguist [[David J. Peterson]] confirmed this, though he modified a few words to match the scene (referring to Daenerys as the \"Dragon Queen\" and to \"Westeros\"). Peterson had to come up with Valyrian words for \"hamster\" and \"elderberry\": the word for \"hamster\" is ''n\u00fdnyghi'' (which Peterson stated was inspired by the Knights Who Say Ni) and the word for \"elderberry\" is ''tomisto'', from High Valyrian ''t\u014dm\u012btsos'', a reference to Peterson's friend Tommy Lieber.<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2014/05/the-valyrian-word-for-hamster/ Dothraki.com], David J. Peterson's blog, May 12, 2014</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Oznak zo Pahl is a noble from [[Meereen]] and a scion of the House of Pahl. He wields a 14-foot lance striped with the colors of his house (pink and white). It is rumored that he once cut the liver out of a man named Scarb who had looked at a Meereenese lady wrongly. Oznak claimed that he was defending the lady's honor, for Scarb had raped her with his eyes. No one dared to question Oznak's act since his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard.\n\nOznak is defeated by \"Strong\" Belwas instead of Daario Naharis, and the events play out slightly different. Daenerys chooses Belwas, a eunuch and former pit fighter, because he is the least important of her protectors, and because if Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if Belwas is defeated - it is a poor victory that Meereen can take no pride in. Belwas evades three of Oznak's charges before injuring his mount on the fourth, forcing him to fight on foot. He does not immediately kill the champion, as he allows his opponent to cut his belly once before finishing them off. He decapitates him, before defecating next to his corpse.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pahl, Oznak zo}}\n[[fr:Oznak zo Pahl]]\n[[de:Oznak zo Pahl]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0437\u043e \u041f\u0430\u043b\u044c]]\n[[Pl:Oznak zo Pahl]]\n[[Category:Ghiscari]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Meereenese]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

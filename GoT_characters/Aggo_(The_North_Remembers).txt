He is one of her [[bloodrider]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nAggo was a member of [[Khal]] [[Drogo]]'s [[khalasar]] and a member of Daenerys' ''khas''. When Drogo's khalasar fractures, he remains loyal to Daenerys. He pledges his fealty to her after the birth of the dragons. She names him as one of her [[bloodrider]]s alongside [[Rakharo]] and [[Kovarro]].<ref name=\"E11\">\"[[The North Remembers]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nDaenerys leads what remains of her khalasar deep into the Red Waste. Facing starvation she sends Rakharo, Aggo, and Kovarro to scout in three different directions, using the last remaining horses. Aggo is sent southeast.<ref name=\"E11\" />\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|1=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aggo is one of the three bodyguards of Daenerys Targaryen and is named both ''ko'' and bloodrider after she hatches her dragon eggs. He's an adept archer who saves Daenerys' life from Cohollo, one of [[Drogo]]'s bloodriders.\n\nFollowing Khal Drogo's death, Aggo and the other two bloodriders Jhogo and Rakharo are among the few who remain with Daenerys. Before entering the funeral pyre, Daenerys gives Aggo the dragonbone bow that was her bride gift and names him her ko. Aggo accepts the bow with lowered eyes, saying \"I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko.\" However, once Daenerys comes out of the pyre alive and with the born dragons, Aggo is the second of the bloodriders to declare \"Blood of my blood\", and since then he is totally loyal to Daenerys.\n\nAfter Daenerys rides Drogon away from Meereen, Aggo and Rakharo go to look for her at the Dothraki sea, instead of Jorah and Daario who are held captive by the Yunkai at that point of the story.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF|Aggo}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n\n[[de:Aggo]]\n[[es:Aggo]]\n[[pl:Aggo]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0433\u0433\u043e]]\n[[fr:Aggo]]\n[[zh:\u963f\u6208]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Bloodriders]]\n[[Category:Queensguard]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Targaryen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

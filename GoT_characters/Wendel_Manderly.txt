During the wedding feast, Ser Wendel sits besides Ser [[Brynden Tully]] and [[Walder Rivers|Black Walder Frey]]. Following the [[bedding]] of the newlyweds, Wendel is [[Red Wedding|murdered]], shot with a quarrel through the back of his head and out his mouth. He dies along with his King and the rest of the Stark bannermen.<ref>\"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nWhen all the Northern lords are gathered in [[Winterfell]] after it is [[Battle of the Bastards|taken back]] by the Starks, [[Lyanna Mormont]] reminds Wendel's father [[Wyman Manderly]] that his son died at the Red Wedding and yet he refused to aid the Starks. Wyman acknowledges this but promises to make amends and joins in declaring [[Jon Snow]] the new King in the North.<ref>\"[[The Winds of Winter]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances|9=yes}}\n\n== Family tree ==\n{{House Manderly family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Wendel Manderly is the second son of Lord Wyman Manderly, the Lord of White Harbor and Warden of the [[White Knife]]. He is not quite as fat as his father and older brother Wylis, but is still considered immense. He is loud and boisterous, wears a large mustache and is bald.\n\nIn \"''A Game of Thrones''\", Wendel and Wylis escort [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] from the White Harbor to Robb's camp, with nearly 1,500 soldiers as reinforcements for the Starks' host. Shortly before the [[battle of the Whispering Wood]], Wendel becomes one of Robb's personal guard.\n\nIn \"''A Clash of Kings''\", Wendel is among the five lordings who escort Catelyn to Renly's camp. \n\nWendel was killed in the book somewhat differently to the show: when the massacre started, he rose to his feet, but an arrow went in his open mouth and came out the back of his neck, killing him instantly. He did not have a chance to resist or surrender.\n\nLord Wyman Manderly hates the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and the [[House Frey|Freys]] for his son's death. He cannot act openly against them as long as his other son Wylis (who was captured at the battle of the Ruby Ford) is held captive by the Lannisters, but he secretly plots to join Stannis and avenge Wendel's death. Once Wylis returns home, Lord Wyman makes an offer to Davos: he will join Stannis on condition that Davos will travel to [[Skagos]] and finds [[Rickon Stark]].\n\nLord Wyman brings [[Frey pie|three huge pies]] to Ramsay's wedding, and serves them to the Boltons and the attending Freys. It is speculated those pies are made of three Freys (Rhaegar, Jared and Symond) who stayed for a while at the White Harbor, and disappeared without a trace on their way to Winterfell - a payback for Wendel's death.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manderly, Wendel}}\n[[de:Wendel Manderly]]\n[[it:Wendel Manderly]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043b \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438]]\n[[fr:Wendel Manderly]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Manderly]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

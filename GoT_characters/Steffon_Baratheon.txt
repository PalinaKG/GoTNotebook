He is the father of [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], and [[Renly Baratheon]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nSteffon Baratheon was the third member of House Baratheon to be named Steffon. He was the Lord of Storm's End and head of House Baratheon, one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. He is the father of Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon. He lived with his family at [[Storm's End]]. Steffon fought in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]] alongside his father, [[Ormund Baratheon]], who, according to singers, died in the arms of Steffon.<ref>\"[[War of the Ninepenny Kings (Histories & Lore)|War of the Ninepenny Kings]]\"</ref>\n\nWhile in a drunken stupor, he once attempted to violate the honor of a noble lady but was subdued by Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] of the [[Kingsguard]], though he was spared on account of his drunkenness.<ref>[[The Iron Throne]]</ref>\n\nSteffon and his wife, [[Cassana Baratheon|Cassana]], died shortly before [[Robert's Rebellion]] when their ship, the ''[[Windproud]]'', sank in [[Shipbreaker Bay]].<ref name = \"s1prop\"/>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nHe has an entry in the ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', as read by [[Eddard Stark]].<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\n[[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] mentions that his father used to tell him that \"boredom indicates a lack of inner resources\".<ref>\"[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nSteffon is mentioned under the entry of Ser Arthur Dayne in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', which the new [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] flicks through.<ref>\"[[The Iron Throne]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Baratheon family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Steffon Baratheon was the son of Lord Ormund Baratheon and Rhaelle Targaryen, the sister of King Jaehaerys II and aunt of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. Despite what maesters claim, this relationship is not what allowed Robert to claim the [[Iron Throne]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]; he seized the Iron Throne by force.\n[[File:Ormund and Steffon Baratheon.png|thumb|220x220px|Steffon holds his father Ormund fallen in battle.]]\nSteffon Baratheon appears to have been an effective lord. He was once defeated by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] during a [[tournament]]. He was sent by King Aerys II to the [[Free Cities]] to find a bride for Prince Rhaegar, but he found no suitable matches. He did find a talented fool, however, one whom he believed would teach even Stannis to laugh. However, Lord Steffon's ship, the ''Windproud'', sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End. His body and that of his wife, Lady Cassana of House Estermont, was never found. The fool, Patchface, did wash ashore, but the trauma of the event robbed him of his wits.\n\nIn his youth, Steffon served as a page at King's Landing, and became close friends with Aerys and [[Tywin Lannister]]. As Aerys's relationship with Tywin deteriorated, many believed that the king would name Steffon as [[Hand of the King]] upon his return from the Free Cities; instead, matters only grew worse after Steffon's death, as Aerys became convinced that Tywin had arranged the sinking of the ''Windproud'' to prevent Steffon from taking his place.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Steffon}}\n\n\n[[de:Steffon Baratheon]]\n[[es:Steffon Baratheon]]\n[[pl:Steffon Baratheon]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0444\u043e\u043d \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u53f2\u8482\u82ac\u00b7\u62dc\u62c9\u5e2d\u6069]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of Storm's End|Steffon]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

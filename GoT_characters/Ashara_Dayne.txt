As the end of the evening approached, Brandon Stark asked her for one more dance on his shy brother's behalf, and so Eddard Stark shared the last dance of the celebration with Lady Ashara Dayne.|[[Meera Reed]]|The Great Tourney at Harrenhal}}\nLady '''Ashara Dayne''' was a lady of [[House Dayne]] and the sister of [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Arthur Dayne]], the [[Sword of the Morning]].\n\n==Biography==\nLady Ashara Dayne was present at the great [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Harrenhal]] in the [[Year of the False Spring]], where she danced with Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and several others. Towards the end of the evening, she was approached by [[Brandon Stark (son of Rickard)|Brandon Stark]] who asked her for a dance on behalf of his shy younger brother [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]]. She accepted and she and Eddard shared the last dance of the celebration.<ref>\"[[The Great Tourney at Harrenhal]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lady Ashara Dayne was renowned for her great beauty. She was tall and had long hair and violet eyes. She was an object of infatuation for many men and including Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and, according to rumor, [[Eddard Stark]].\n\nAshara was a lady-in-waiting to Princess [[Elia Martell]].\n\nFollowing the [[Showdown at the Tower of Joy]], [[Eddard Stark]] traveled to [[Starfall]] to inform [[House Dayne]] of Ser [[Arthur Dayne]]'s death and return his sword, [[Dawn]]. Ashara committed suicide by throwing herself from the top of the Palestone Sword, the tallest tower in [[Starfall]], onto the cliff atop the sea. Her body was never found.\n\nAshara was suspected to be the mother of [[Jon Snow]], and that her suicide was caused by the grief over the hand her alleged lover Eddard played in her brother's death. [[Catelyn Stark]] asked him if this was true, and Eddard angrily told her to never ask him about Jon, that the boy was his blood and that this was all she needed to know. Ashara's name was never mentioned in [[Winterfell]] again after this.\n\nDespite these rumors, [[Barristan Selmy]] believed that Ashara had given birth to a stillborn daughter, and that a man had dishonored her during the tourney at Harrenhal. While remembering what Ashara Dayne looked like, he remarks that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] resembles her, sharing the same violet eyes as her. He claims that when Daenerys looked at him, he felt that he was looking at Ashara's supposed daughter.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Dayne navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dayne, Ashara}}\n[[de:Ashara Dayn]]\n[[fr:Ashara Dayne]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0448\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Dayne]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

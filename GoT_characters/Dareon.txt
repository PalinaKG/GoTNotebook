Dareon is assigned to the Stewards and [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] sends him to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], where he is to present himself to [[Borcas]].<ref>\"[[You Win or You Die]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nWhile fleeing back to the Wall, [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] tells [[Gilly]] that it will be pleasant at Castle Black: [[Hobb]] the cook makes nice food, and Dareon often sings at meal-time.<ref>\"[[The Climb]]\"</ref>\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nFollowing the [[Breaching of the Wall]], Daeron's fate remains unknown.<ref>\"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|7=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dareon is an apprentice singer from the [[Reach]], sent to the [[Wall]] after being caught in bed with a daughter of Lord Mathis Rowan. Even though Dareon maintains that she was waiting for him naked and helped him into her room, she named it rape under her father's eye.\n\nHe's also an excellent singer, known to sing for the Watch during dinners; Maester Aemon describes his voice as \"honey poured over thunder.\" Jon describes him as \"quick but afraid of being hit.\"\n\nIn \"A Feast for Crows\" Jon sends Dareon alongside Sam, Gilly and Maester Aemon to [[Oldtown]] via [[Braavos]], hoping that Dareon's singing would encourage recruitment to the Night's Watch. Dareon, however, spends his time in Braavos whoring and drinking. Sam finds Dareon in a brothel, where he married a whore. Sam confronts Dareon for breaking his vows and demands that he return with him to the inn where they stay, but Dareon teases him. For the first time in his life, Sam loses his temper and beats Dareon up, and is thrown from the brothel. Sam, Gilly and Aemon leave Braavos for Oldtown without Dareon.\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] followes Dareon to a dark alley, slits his throat and loots his body. It is the first time Arya murders in cold blood someone who never did any ill to her, her family or her friends, and did not threaten or provoke her in any way. She justifies her deed by claiming that Dareon was a deserter of the Night's Watch, but it is doubtful that Arya - who dissociated herself from her past life, thus no longer considered as Stark or Westerosi - had the right to act as the prosecutor/judge/executioner, and the way she killed Dareon did not resemble even closely to a formal execution. After committing that murder, Arya is given the milk that makes her blind.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n\n\n[[de:Dareon]]\n[[es:Dareon]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u6234\u5229\u6069]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Stewards of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

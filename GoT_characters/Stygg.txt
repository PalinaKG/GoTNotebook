He took part in the [[Fall of Winterfell|seizing]] of [[Winterfell]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nStygg is present at the [[Sack of Winterfell|siege of Winterfell]] when [[Theon Greyjoy]] gives a speech encouraging his crew to resist the Northmen led by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] and die a glorious death. Instead, [[Dagmer]] knocks Theon unconscious and the garrison surrenders.<ref>\"[[Valar Morghulis]]\"</ref>\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\n[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] learn that the ironborn captured at Winterfell were all [[Flaying|flayed]] alive on Ramsay Snow's orders, despite being promised mercy if they surrendered.<ref>\"[[Mhysa]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|10=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Stygg's background is the same. He is among the ironborn who raid the [[Stony Shore]] and part of the force that captures Winterfell.\n\nWhen the residents of Winterfell are gathered and told that they are captives of the ironborn, Stygg kills [[Mikken]] for speaking defiantly to Theon. [[Osha]] offers to serve Theon (falsely, while she stays loyal to the Starks), Stygg taunts her rudely, and in response she knees him in the groin and grabs his spear, to the amusement of Theon and the other ironborn. After the capture, Theon sends\u00a0him to request aid from his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Asha]] at [[Deepwood Motte]].\n\nAs Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join his sister's troops at Deepwood Motte or stay and fight with him against the Northmen who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Stygg is among those who abandon Theon, and he is the only of those who has the grace to look ashamed.\n\nStygg is not mentioned in the books afterwards.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n\n[[ru:\u0421\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0433]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Scholars of all sorts flocked to Oldtown to debate and write and...debate. After this Prince Peremore's death, his brother granted land to \"Peremore's Pets\", as the wise men were called, though now they're known as Maesters.|[[Samwell Tarly]]|The Citadel}}\nPrince '''Peremore Hightower''' was the younger brother of King [[Urrigon Hightower]] and is believed to be a founder of the [[Order of Maesters]].\n\n==Biography==\nPeremore was a second son of [[House Hightower]], and surrounded himself with scholars and priests, enjoying enquiries and debates. After Peremore died, his elder brother King Urrigon supposedly gave land that would become the [[Citadel]] as a home for the learned men, referred to in legend as Peremore's \"pets\". This allowed them to continue their work, allegedly laying the foundations for the Order of Maesters.<ref>\"[[Oldtown (Histories & Lore)|Oldtown]]\"</ref><ref>\"[[The Citadel]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nThe Order of Maesters was founded many centuries before the [[Andal Invasion]], from the original guild of scholars that Peremore gathered together in [[Oldtown]]. Peremore was the second son of King Uthor of the Hightower, who allegedly also contracted [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Brandon the Builder]] to rebuild the Hightower in Oldtown, nearly 8,000 years ago (Uthor and Peremore may have actually lived many centuries later, if at all, and later got mixed up with other legends).\n\nPeremore was born with a withered arm and twisted back. Sickly, he devoted himself to intellectual pursuits, patronizing various scholars, and he enjoyed nothing more than hearing them debate.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hightower, Peremore}}\n[[de:Peremor Hohenturm]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hightower]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

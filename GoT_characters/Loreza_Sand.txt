Loreza is only six years old during the events of the fourth and fifth novels (corresponding to Season 5 of the TV series), so she has not done much yet within the narrative.\n\nAfter [[Doran Martell]] hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he orders to arrest them lest they ignite a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and their younger sisters too (except [[Sarella Sand|Sarella]]), fearing that the young Sand Snakes may be used by others in plots against him. Loreza is sent to the [[Water Gardens]] alongside her mother and her three sisters. Following the arrival of Ser [[Balon Swann]], Doran releases Loreza, her mother and sisters.\n\nIn \"Arianne I\" sample chapter from the sixth novel, it is mentioned Loreza, who has just turned seven, is currently traveling with her mother to\u00a0[[Hellholt]], seat of her grandfather\u00a0Harmen Uller.\u00a0\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sand, Loreza}}\n[[pl:Loreza Sand]]\n[[pt-br:Loreza Sand]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u0421\u044d\u043d\u0434]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

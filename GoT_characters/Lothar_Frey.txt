Roslin.|Lothar Frey|The Climb}}\n'''Lothar Frey''' was one of the many sons of [[Walder Frey]], [[Lord of the Crossing]] and head of [[House Frey]]. He was often referred to as \"'''Lame Lothar'''\" due to the pronounced limp he has in his left leg.\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nLothar is a son of [[Walder Frey]], the [[Lord of the Crossing]]. He is the [[Steward|steward]] of the [[Twins]], managing the day-to-day running of the castle. He often plans and organizes the fine details to achieve his father's goals.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nLothar travels to [[Riverrun]] with Lord Walder's [[bastard]] son, [[Walder Rivers|Black Walder]], and meets with King [[Robb Stark]] and his advisors to discuss the reforging of the [[Stark]]-[[Frey]] alliance for Robb's planned attack on [[Casterly Rock]]. The Freys carry Lord Walder's demands, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle of [[Harrenhal]] and all of its lands and incomes, and for [[Edmure Tully]] to marry [[Roslin Tully|Roslin]], one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced to go through with the arrangement.<ref>\"[[The Climb]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Talisa_Stabbed.jpg|thumb|Lothar kills Talisa.]]\nLothar hires a group of assassins to pose as musicians at Edmure and Roslin's [[Red Wedding|wedding]]. [[Talisa Stark]] comments on their talent, and Lothar replies that they should want to be good due to their cost. After the [[bedding]] ceremony, Lord Walder rises to make a toast to Robb and offer a marriage gift to his Queen, signaling Lothar to draw a knife from his sleeve and repeatedly stab the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, fatally wounding her and killing her unborn child. Angered by the atrocity visited upon his wife and child, Robb prepares to draw his sword and most likely go after their killer, but he takes a few arrows by the musician-assassins hired by Lothar, who presumably continues to participate in the ensuing massacre.<ref>\"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nLothar and Black Walder inform their father that [[Brynden Tully]] has retaken [[Riverrun]], and of the opposition they face from other Riverlands houses and the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. Walder admonishes his sons for letting the Blackfish slip through their fingers at the Red Wedding and orders them to retake Riverrun by using the captive Edmure for bargaining with. He also tells Lothar to present Brynden with the knife he used to kill Talisa and her unborn child.<ref>\"[[Blood of My Blood]]\"</ref> Subsequently, Lothar and Black Walder command a [[Second Siege of Riverrun|siege of Riverrun]]. They prove to be incompetent commanders and fail to secure their flanks or to dig trenches. \n[[File:The Broken Man 11.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Lothar is chastised by Jaime Lannister.]]\nIn an attempt to force the Blackfish to surrender, they force Edmure to wear a noose around his neck and threaten to kill him. However, the Blackfish is undaunted and calls their bluff. Later, [[House Lannister]] reinforcements arrive under [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Bronn]]. Jaime chastises the Freys for their incompetence and takes command of the siege. He also orders Lothar and Black Walder to feed and wash Edmure. When Black Walder refuses, Jaime backhands him across the face and informs the Freys that they can return home if they do not agree with his methods. Lothar is apologetic and sycophantic in contrast to his bastard half-brother.<ref>\"[[The Broken Man]]\"</ref>\n[[File:610 Frey pie 1.png|thumb|180x180px|Lothar is carved into a pie.]]\nLothar is later present at the Twins, where the Freys and the Lannisters celebrate their successful siege of Riverrun. He is afterwards [[Assassinations at the Twins|killed]] by [[Arya Stark]], who presumably learns (while disguised as a servant) of how he killed her pregnant sister-in-law. She minces his flesh and bakes him into [[Frey pie|a pie]] together with Black Walder, which she then serves to their father before slitting his throat, as Black Walder did to her [[Catelyn Stark|mother]].<ref>\"[[The Winds of Winter]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nLothar and Black Walder's remaining male family members are poisoned by Arya, who hosts a banquet using the face of their father.<ref>\"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen asked by [[Hot Pie]] if she has made any pies recently, Arya repsonds with \"a few\", referring to the deaths of Lothar and Black Walder.<ref>\"[[Stormborn]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances|6=yes|9=yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances||||||yes|yes|yes||yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Frey family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lothar Frey is often referred to as \"Lame Lothar\", on account of his crippled leg, and serves as the [[Steward]] of the Twins. He is the twelfth son of Lord Walder Frey, the first from his marriage to his fourth wife, Lady Alyssa Blackwood.\n\nLothar is described as plump, with close-set eyes, a pointed beard, and dark hair in ringlets to his shoulders. His leg was twisted at birth. Unlike the TV version, he is intelligent and cunning despite his handicap. As Steward of the Twins he holds the important position of overseeing the day-to-day running of his father's castle. When it comes to politics or war, Walder Frey determines the general course that House Frey will take, but it is often Lame Lothar who then plans and organizes the fine details to achieve his father's goals. Thus he is one of the major ringleaders within House Frey.\n\nIn the third book, Lame Lothar and Walder Rivers (not Black Walder) come to Riverrun to deliver Lord Frey's offer. While they converse with the Starks, Lothar speaks tactfully, and smoothly apologizes for Walder Rivers's blunt words. Lothar also acts very courteously toward the Starks when they arrive at the Twins, cunningly hiding his vile intentions.\n\nWhile courteous on the surface, Lothar can also be extremely vicious. After his father decided to betray the Starks, Lame Lothar handled most of the specific planning for the ambush (consulting with [[Roose Bolton]]), appointing the specific tasks that would be followed out during the attack. It was his idea to hire the sellswords disguised as musicians to play ''[[The Rains of Castamere]]'' to signal the start of the Red Wedding massacre. He also has the idea of rigging the tents in the Stark's camp to collapse, trapping the soldiers inside as they're set alight. Even other members of his family believe him to be far more dangerous than he outwardly appears.\n\nLothar doesn't kill Robb's wife in the books because she is not even present at the Red Wedding. Robb's wife in the books is Jeyne Westerling (who was changed to \"Talisa Maegyr\" in the TV version), and she never became pregnant by Robb in the books. Robb left her for safety at Riverrun before traveling to the Twins with the rest of the Stark army. [[Richard Madden]] (Robb Stark) explained that the TV series simply killed off Talisa at the Red Wedding along with everyone else, because otherwise viewers would hold out hope that she would give birth to a son that would avenge Robb just as viewers used to think that Robb would live to avenge his father Eddard - they wanted to make it clear that they are avoiding such narrative clich\u00e9s.\n\nIn the books, Lothar does not take part in the [[Second Siege of Riverrun#In the books|siege of Riverrun]]. \n\nLothar is still alive by the point the books reached. He is not one of the three Freys (Jared, Rhaegar and Symond) who are allegedly killed by [[Wyman Manderly]], as a payback for his son's death at the Red Wedding, then baked into pies and served at Ramsay's wedding.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Frey navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frey, Lothar}}\n\n<!--Interwiki links-->\n\n[[de:Lothar Frey]]\n[[fr:Lothar Frey]]\n[[pt-br:Lothar Frey]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u0424\u0440\u0435\u0439]]\n[[uk:\u041b\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u0424\u0440\u0435\u0439]]\n[[zh:\u7f57\u7d22\u00b7\u4f5b\u96f7]]\n[[ro:Lothar Frey]]\n[[Category:Stewards|Frey, Lothar]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Frey]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

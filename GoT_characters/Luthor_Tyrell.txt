The night before he was due to propose to her, however, Viola's sister Olenna \"stumbled\" upon his bedchamber after allegedly getting lost after her embroidery lesson. The next morning, Luthor did not propose to Viola; in fact, he never left his chamber, as he couldn't walk, and could only think of what Olenna had given him the night before.<ref>\"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nLord Luthor's widow, Lady Olenna, describes her late husband to\u00a0[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\u00a0as \"an oaf\". She explains that her husband died when he rode\u00a0over a cliff while hawking. He had been looking up and not paying attention to where his horse was going. She used the incident as a metaphor for the Tyrells' alliance with the Lannisters.<ref>\"[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nAfter [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is [[Purple Wedding|poisoned and dies]] right in front of [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]], she is left somewhat shaken. Days later, wearing mourning clothes, Olenna recalls to her that Luthor was an oaf she had to sit through boring banquets with and produce heirs with - but it was still horrifying after he died in his hunting accident, when they brought him back and she saw his lifeless corpse laid out on a table. Olenna seems uncharacteristically a little upset, though she tries to hide it, as she clearly didn't ''rejoice'' when Luthor died.<ref>\"[[Breaker of Chains]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Tyrell family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Luthor Tyrell's backstory remains the same, except that it was planned for him to marry Shaera Targaryen, a member of [[House Targaryen]], who was cut out in the show to simplify the Targaryen dynasty, and not another Redwyne.\n\nAfter a short conversation with Olenna, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] wonders if Luthor deliberately rode off that cliff.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Tyrell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tyrell, Luthor}}\n\n[[de:Luthor Tyrell]]\n[[es:Luthor Tyrell]]\n[[fr:Luthor Tyrell]]\n[[it:Luthor Tyrell]]\n[[nl:Luthor Tyrel]]\n[[pl:Luthor Tyrell]]\n[[ro:Luthor Tyrell]] \n[[ru:\u041b\u044e\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0422\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043b]]\n[[zh:\u7f57\u65af\u00b7\u63d0\u5229\u5c14]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tyrell]]\n[[Category:Wardens]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of Highgarden|Luthor]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

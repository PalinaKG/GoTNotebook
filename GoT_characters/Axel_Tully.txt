He built right up to the water on each side, daring attackers to force a crossing.|[[Brynden Tully]]|Riverrun (Histories & Lore)}}\nLord '''Axel Tully''' was the founder of [[Riverrun]].\n\n==Biography==\nDue to the [[Riverlands]]' lack of natural defenses, Axel decided to construct the castle Riverrun for [[House Tully]]. He raised it where [[Trident#The Red Fork|Red Fork]] and the [[Tumblestone]] rivers meet. The castle was built with water to each side. This forced soldiers to cross the river in order to breach the castle. Those wearing armor would drown, and would otherwise be within range of archers placed on the battlements.<ref>\"[[Riverrun (Histories & Lore)|Riverrun]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Axel Tully was the first [[Lord of Riverrun]]. He was the son of Ser Edmure Tully, a turncoat who supported the [[Andal]] warlord Armistead Vance following the death of the [[King of the Rivers and Hills]], Tristifer IV Mudd. It was from Vance that Axel received the grant of lands upon which he built [[Riverrun]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Tully navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tully, Axel}}\n[[de:Axel Tully]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0422\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438]]\n[[Category:Lords of Riverrun]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tully]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

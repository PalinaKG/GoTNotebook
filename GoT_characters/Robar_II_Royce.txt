While the Andals had mounted knights, the First Men were on foot and held the high ground, strengthening their position by lining it with sharpened stakes smeared with offal and excrement. Initially holding against six charges from the Andal cavalry, the line was broken by [[Torgold Tollett]], allowing the knights to rush through the gap.\n\nHowever, Robar decided not to retreat, and instead rode after Ser Artys with the intent of scattering the Andal knights by killing their leader. He took the [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Lady Forlorn]] from the dead Andal lord [[Qyle Corbray]], and duelled with Ser Artys, a story later celebrated by singers. Robar managed to cut off the Falcon Knight's head, only to see 500 Andal knights behind him, led by Ser Artys himself, who had dressed one of his knights in his spare armor and thus tricked Robar. The knights had taken a goat path known to Ser Artys, and killed King Robar, destroying his forces and ending the rule of the First Men over the Vale.<ref>\"[[Knights of the Vale]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Robar II Royce was the grandson of Yorwyck VI Royce. He inherited the crown of the [[Bronze King]] less than a fortnight before his sixteenth birthday. He united the houses and clans of the [[First Men]] that still held out against the [[Andal]]s. He brought together many marriages and granted a lot of land and gold, and one legend states that he cheated in an archery contest against Lord Hunter. He was granted the title of High King of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], the [[Fingers]], and the [[Mountains of the Moon]].\n\nKing Robar would focus his war efforts on one enemy at a time due to the Andal houses' habit of falling to petty rivalries and infighting.  Legend has it that he killed Ser [[Qyle Corbray]] with [[Lady Forlorn]] after striking the sword from Ser Qyle's hand. He later defeated the Hammer of the Hills at [[Ironoaks]] while his sister retook [[Gulltown]] by convincing the Shetts to rise up against the Graftons.\n\nThe Andals united under Ser [[Artys Arryn|Artys I Arryn]] at fight back against Robar and his forces. The two armies met in the [[Battle of the Seven Stars]], with singers claiming that Robar's army threw back six Andal charges before the seventh broke through. Robar then led a counterattack and killed [[Torgold Tollett]] with Lady Forlorn. He then charged at a man he believed Ser Artys and slew him, but five hundred [[Knighthood|knights]] charged down [[Giant's Lance]] and attacked Robar's army from behind. Leading them was Ser Artys, with the man Robar had killed having been a decoy. Robar was killed in the ensuing bout, though it is unknown by whom. Ser Jaime Corbray reclaimed Lady Forlorn and Ser Artys became [[King of the Mountain and the Vale]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Royce, Robar II}}\n[[fr:Robar II Royce]]\n[[de:Robar Rois (K\u00f6nig)]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440 II \u0420\u043e\u0439\u0441]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Bronze Kings]]\n[[Category:Lords of Runestone]]\n[[Category:Members of House Royce]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:First Men]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

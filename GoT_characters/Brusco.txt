The Kindly Man describes him as \"a good man with a bad back\". [[Brea]] (who appears as a prostitute in the show) is his eldest daughter in the novels. He has one more daughter named\u00a0Talea, and at least two sons. He is sparing with his words and his coin.\n\nSome time after Arya arrives at the House of Black and White, the Kindly Man orders her to work for Brusco, as a part of her apprentice. Arya does well selling his merchandise (oysters, clams, crabs, mussels, cockles, sometimes prawns). During her work she befriends many people, learns the Braavosi tongue and hears many secrets. After she kills [[Dareon]], she brings Brusco his purse and boots. Brusco does not ask her where she got those.\n\nDuring the period that Arya is blind, she misses Brusco and his daughters a lot. After she is given her eyesight back, she returns to work for Brusco, as if she had never been away.\n\nIn Arya's sample chapter (\"Mercy\") of the sixth book, it is revealed Brusco is one of the actors at [[Izembaro]]'s\u00a0theatre. He plays the role of the boar in the play ''[[The Bloody Hand]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Brusco Bouncer}}\n\n[[ru:\u0411\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Braavosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

For this, Maegor [[Execution|beheaded]] Myros and officially declared war on the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]].<ref name=\"Maegor\"/>\n\nWhen Queen Alys miscarried, Tyanna declared that she had been unfaithful, and wrote a list of potential fathers of the stillborn child. The king executed Alys and her father, Lord [[Lucas Harroway]], the [[Hand of the King]]. He then marched on [[Harrenhal]] and slaughtered the entire [[House Harroway|Harroway]] family.<ref name=\"Maegor\"/>\n\nTyanna was also unable to give Maegor an heir. Desperate, Maegor took three more wives, known as the [[Black Brides]].<ref name=\"Maegor\"/>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Tyanna was rumored to be the natural daughter of a Pentoshi [[magister]]. She was a tavern dancer and later a [[Prostitution|courtesan]]. She was the first [[Master of Whisperers]] (using the feminine title \"mistress of whisperers\"). She was Maegor's third wife, and the fourth to die of his six wives.\n\nIn 48 AC, she was seized and taken to the dungeons to be tortured. As the [[Kingsguard]]s Owen Bush and Maladon Moore prepared their tools, she confessed responsibility for the abonimations that [[Alys Harroway]] and [[Jeyne Westerling]] produced, and vowed that the same would happen to [[Elinor Costayne]]. Maegor cut out her heart with [[Blackfyre]] and fed her to his [[dog]]s. Tyanna's promise about Elinor came true: two months later, she gave birth to a stillborn monstrosity as well.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Pentoshi]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0411\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Catelyn declines, pointing out that too large of a traveling party will attract unwanted attention. Instead, Catelyn only allows Rodrik himself to accompany her.<ref>\"[[The Kingsroad]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]] ===\nAfter hearing about an attack on [[Torrhen's Square]], the seat of [[House Tallhart]], Ser Rodrik leads a force of 200 men away from Winterfell to defend the Tallharts, leaving\u00a0Winterfell highly undefended;\u00a0an\u00a0[[ironborn]]\u00a0force led by [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] easily [[Fall of Winterfell|seizes the castle]]. It is likely that Hallis Mollen died defending Winterfell, as he is never seen again.\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Hallis Mollen is Jory Cassel's replacement as captain of the guards at Winterfell, after Jory travels with [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] to King's Landing. He is muscular and has a square brown beard. He has a loose tongue and tendency to state the obvious.\n\nIn the books, following Ned's arrest, Hallis goes south with [[Robb Stark]]'s army and takes part in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]]. Later he accompanies Catelyn south when she goes to treat with [[Renly Baratheon]] at [[Storm's End]]. After Catelyn receives Ned's bones at [[Riverrun]], she orders Hallis to escort them back to Winterfell for proper burial in the crypts. What happened to Hallis's party is unknown, except that they never reached their destination.\n\nIn the TV series, Ned's bones are delivered instead by [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], at Tyrion's request, at Renly's camp in the [[Stormlands]]. In \"[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]\", Jon says \"We're going to bury [[Rickon Stark|my brother]] in the crypt next to my father\" -\u00a0indicating\u00a0that Ned's bones have been\u00a0brought to Winterfell and buried in the crypts.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\u00a0\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mollen, Hallis}}\n\n[[de:Hallis Mollen]]\n[[es:Hallis Mollen]]\n[[it:Hallis Mollen]]\n[[nl:Hallis Mollen]]\n[[zh:\u54c8\u91cc\u65af\u00b7\u83ab\u5170]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0441 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:Captains of the Guards|Mollen, Hallis]]\n[[Category:House Mollen|Hallis]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

He's also known as \"Gelmarr the Grim\". Gelmarr takes part in the raid of [[Stony Shore]], the [[Fall of Winterfell|assault on Winterfell]] and the hunt for [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]].\n\nGelmarr, alongside [[Aggar]] and Gynir Rednose, takes part, at Theon's orders, in the abduction and killing of the unnamed [[Jack#In the books|miller's]] [[Billy#In the books|sons]], whose corpses are passed off as Bran's and Rickon's. Gelmarr also kills the kids' mother with one blow of his axe, as she cries to Theon for mercy.\n\nThe very night they return from Acorn Water, Gelmarr allegedly tumbles down some steps and breaks his back; Aggar and Gynir are also killed within the next days. Later it is revealed that the three were secretly killed by \"Reek\" (actually, Ramsay in disguise) at Theon's command, to prevent them from revealing the truth about the slain children; since Theon needs a scapegoat, he falsely accuses [[Farlen]] of the killing and executes him.\n\nIn ''A Dance with Dragons'', when some men mysteriously die one by one at Winterfell, Theon is reminded of Aggar, Gelmarr, and Gynir.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n\n[[ru:\u0413\u0435\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0440]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

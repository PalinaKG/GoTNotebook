She had two brothers, [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], and one half-sister, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]].<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n== In the books ==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Helaena Targaryen was the second daughter of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] by his only daughter by his second wife Queen [[Alicent Hightower]], born in 109 AC. As a child, she was plumper and less striking than most members of [[House Targaryen]], but was pleasant and happy nonetheless and beloved by the [[smallfolk]] as she grew older. She became a dragonrider by age twelve, with [[Dreamfyre]] as her steed. At thirteen, she was [[Marriage|married]] to her older brother [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. Barely a year later, she gave birth to the twins [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jarhaera]].\n\nOn the first day of 127 AC, King Viserys held a feast to celebrate his healthy recovery. The court [[fool]] Mushroom claimed that once the king had left the feast, Helaena's nephew, Prince [[Jacaerys Velaryon]], asked her to dance, which her brother and husband Aegon took offence to. Later that same year Helaena gave birth to her third child, [[Maelor Targaryen|Maelor]].\n\nOn the third day of the third month of 129 AC, Helaena brought her children to see their grandfather as he lay on his deathbed. He entertained them with a fictional tale about great-great-grandfather King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]]. Helaena was informed of her father's death the day after his body was discovered. She became queen when her husband Aegon was crowned king, with her mother Alicent placing a crown upon her head and calling her \"my Queen\".\n\nHelaena's older half-sister [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], whom Viserys had intended to be his successor on the [[Iron Throne]], refused to accept Aegon as her king and crowned herself as Queen of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. Rhaenyra declared Queen Alicent and her father Ser [[Otto Hightower]] to be traitors, but expressed willingness to forgive Helaena and her children if they came to Dragonstone and swore fealty to her. [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] suggested traveling to Dragonstone to convince Rhaenyra to give up her claim, which Helaena and Alicent spoke in favor of, and Aegon agreed to send him to Dragonstone under a peace banner.\n\nRhaenyra refused to give up her claim and the [[Dance of the Dragons]] broke out. Helaena would bring her children to her mother's chambers in the [[Tower of the Hand]] each night before putting them to bed. A former [[Gold Cloaks|Gold Cloak]] known as [[Blood]] and a rat-catcher known as [[Cheese]] were aware of this fact and were hired by Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] to murder one of Helaena's sons. They hid in Alicent's bedchambers, bound and gagged her and murdered her bedmaid. Upon Helaena's arrival, they killed her guardsmen and barred the door, taking Helaena her children hostage. They ordered her to choose which of her sons would die. She offered herself, but they refused and Blood threatened to [[rape]] Jaehaera and kill all three children if they Helaena did not make a decision. She reluctantly chose Maelor, whom she deemed too young to understand the situation, but the men killed Jaehaerys instead. Following this, Helaena fell into depression and later descended into depression. She refused to eat, drink or leave her bedchambers and could no longer look at her surviving son Maelor, consumed by the guilt of knowing she had named him to die.\n\nHelaena and Aegon slept apart after Jaehaerys' murder and she did not even come to visit him after he was injured in the [[Siege of Rook's Rest]]. She was taken [[hostage]] by the [[Blacks]] following the [[Fall of King's Landing]]. At age twenty-one, Helaena jumped from her window in [[Maegor's Holdfast]] and was impaled on the spikes below. That knight the smallfolk rioted through [[King's Landing]] demanding justice of the beloved Helaena and her dead sons.\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Targaryen navbox}}\n}}\n[[de:Helaena Targaryen]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d]]\n[[pl:Helaena Targaryen]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Halaena}}\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Greens]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

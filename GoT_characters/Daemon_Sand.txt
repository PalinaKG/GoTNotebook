He witnesses the Red Viper's death at the hands of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].<ref>\"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 4 appearances||||||||yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Daemon Sand, also known as \"The Bastard of Godsgrace\", is Ser Ryon Allyrion's [[Bastardy|natural born son]]. He serves Oberyn Martell as squire, and received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. There are also rumors that he is one of Oberyn's lovers, though this is seldom said to his face.\n\nDaemon is close friends with Arianne Martell, daughter and heir of Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]], and took her maidenhood when they were both fourteen. When Prince Doran learned of this he didn't seek to punish Daemon, but refused to allow him to marry his daughter.\n\nDaemon is first introduced when he arrives at King's Landing among Oberyn's retinue. In \"A Feast for Crows\", [[Qyburn]] informs [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] that Daemon was imprisoned at Doran's command, because he demanded that the [[Sand Snakes]] - who were imprisoned to prevent them from igniting a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] - be released. Eventually, Doran has him freed alongside Princess Arianne and the Sand Snakes.\n\nDaemon is present at the feast when Ser [[Balon Swann]] arrives at [[Sunspear]] to deliver the Mountain's head. He is one of those who express their disapproval by not joining the toast Doran makes to King Tommen.\n\nCurrently, he is escorting Arianne to meet the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia, and [[Jon Connington]]; Daemon believe they are impostors.\n\nHe is considered to be one of Dorne's finest swordsmen.\n\n[[House Allyrion]] belongs to the group known as \"Salty Dornishmen\", who live along the coasts of [[Dorne]] and the [[Greenblood]] river system. This group has the most [[Rhoynar]] blood of all [[Dornishmen]] and generally possess olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. Daemon's brief appearance in Season 4 of the TV series did not resemble this, but as it turns out, in the books he is not described as having classic \"salty Dornish\" features. Instead, he is said to have sky blue eyes and light sandy brown hair. The simple explanation may be that he takes after his non-Allyrion parent in looks, and this parent was either a \"stony Dornishman\" from the western mountains, or possibly from somewhere outside of Dorne entirely.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sand, Daemon}}\n[[de:Daemon Sand]]\n[[es:Daemon Arena]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0421\u044d\u043d\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u6234\u8499\u00b7\u6c99\u5fb7]]\n[[Category:Squires]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Knights]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

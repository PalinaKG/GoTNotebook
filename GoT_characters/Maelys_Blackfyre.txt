Like previous members of [[House Blackfyre]], he proclaimed himself the rightful king as a descendant of [[Daemon I Blackfyre]], [[bastard]] son of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], while the main Targaryen line descended from Aegon IV's lawful son King [[Daeron II Targaryen]]. Maelys rallied an army of mercenaries in the [[Free Cities]] and began a conquest of the [[Stepstones]] as a prelude to invading Westeros itself. The Targaryens attacked the Stepstones before he could launch the invasion, leading to the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. This conflict ended when Maelys was killed in the Stepstones by the young Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], extinguishing Daemon Blackfyre's line and ending further threat of Blackfyre pretenders.<ref>\"[[The Death of Kings]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nMaelys is mentioned under the entry of Barristan Selmy, in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', which the new [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] was flicking through.

He had a huge upper body and a second head sprouting from his neck. This was said to be the head of his twin whom he had absorbed in the womb, earning him the nickname \"Maelys the Monstrous\".\n\nMaelys was named Captain-General of the [[Golden Company]] after killing his cousin Daemon when they fought for the position, becoming a kinslayer for the second time, although this time by choice. The freakishly strong Maelys killed Daemon's horse with a single mighty punch, then twisted Daemon's head around and tore it bare-handed from his shoulders.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], Maelys was one of the Band of Nine, a group of merchants, sellswords, and pirates who joined forces to carve kingdoms out for themselves. After conquering the [[Disputed Lands]], [[Tyrosh]] and the [[Stepstones]], Maelys convinced the other members of the band to attack [[Westeros]] and aid him in retaking what he claimed was his birthright. However, [[House Targaryen|the Targaryens]] acted swiftly and sent their own force out to the Stepstones to meet him. There, Maelys was slain by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] in single combat on the Stepstones, ending the Blackfyre pretensions to the [[Iron Throne]].\n\nThe exact line of descent from Daemon I to Maelys is unclear. Daemon had seven sons and several daughters. Based on chronology, he was apparently Daemon I's grandson, but it isn't known from which of his children.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF|Maelys I Blackfyre}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Blackfyre pretenders}}\n\n[[de:Maelys I.

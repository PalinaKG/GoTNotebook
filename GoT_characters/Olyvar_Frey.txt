He expects a knighthood in good time.|[[Catelyn Stark]] to [[Robb Stark]]|Baelor}}\n'''Olyvar Frey''' was one of the many sons of [[Walder Frey]], [[Lord of the Crossing]], and was a [[squire]] to [[King]] [[Robb Stark]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nWhen [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] negotiates with Lord Frey to gain permission for [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and his army to pass the [[Twins]], one of Walder's demands is for his son Olyvar be made Robb's squire, and eventually be knighted. Robb accepts these terms.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nUnless he died sometime during the [[War of the Five Kings]], Olyvar is supposedly [[Assassinations at the Twins|murdered]], along with his other male family members, by [[Arya Stark|Arya]], as a payback for the [[Red Wedding]].\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Frey family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Olyvar is the eighteenth son of Lord Walder overall and the fourth born to Lord Walder's sixth wife, Bethany [[House Rosby|Rosby]]. His three older brothers are Perwyn, Benfrey, Willamen, and his younger sister is [[Roslin Tully|Roslin]]. He is two years older than Robb, although he is very immature compared to Robb. He takes part in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]].\n\nWhen Robb breaks his marriage pact with [[House Frey]], Olyvar wants to remain with him, but is forced by Ryman ([[Stevron Frey|Stevron]]'s eldest son) to abandon Robb.\n\nOlyvar, alongside his brother Perwyn and nephew Alesander, are kept in the dark about Lord Frey's plan to betray and kill Robb at the [[Red Wedding]]. Apparently it was suspected that the three of them were too loyal to Robb, and would try to warn him or even to defend him when the ambush commenced, so they are sent away from the Twins \"on duty\". Catelyn and Robb ask about the absence of those three Freys, but receive only evasive answers. Too late, as the massacre begins, Catelyn realizes the significance of their absence.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Frey navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frey, Olyvar}}\n\n[[de:Olyvar Frey]]\n[[pl:Olyvar Frey]]\n[[es:Olyvar Frey]]\n[[nl:Olyvar Frey]]\n[[zh:\u5965\u5229\u6cd5\u00b7\u4f5b\u96f7]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u0424\u0440\u0435\u0439]]\n[[fr:Olyvar Frey]]\n[[ro:Olyvar Frey]]\n[[Category:Members of House Frey]]\n[[Category:Squires]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Omelete.</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] later learns Wylla is a servant of [[House Dayne]] of [[Starfall]] and has been for many years. When she is with the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], one of their members is the young Edric \"Ned\" Dayne, the new head of House Dayne. He explains that Wylla was his wet-nurse at Starfall, and that she previously also nursed Jon (who is about four years older than Edric). He doesn't know how or in what circumstances Wylla met Eddard, because he was born a few years after Eddard and Jon left, and no one ever said more about it. Wylla was therefore alive for some time after Jon's birth, but it is unknown if she is still alive.\n\nThe novels make the mystery of Wylla truly being Jon's mother more overt than in the TV series. Jon is repeatedly noted for his striking physical resemblance to Ned at a young age, more so than any of Ned's trueborn sons - thus no one denies that Jon must have Stark blood in him.\n\nThroughout the course of the novels, many characters mention rumors about other women who could be Jon's mother, or speculate about it themselves. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] herself heard maidservants discussing the rumor that Jon's mother was [[Ashara Dayne]] of Starfall - Edric's own aunt, not just a servant. Ashara's brother was [[Arthur Dayne]] of the [[Kingsguard]], whom Ned and his allies killed in the final confrontation of the war, the [[Showdown at the Red Mountains]]. Afterwards Ned returned the Dayne ancestral sword [[Dawn]] to Starfall out of respect, at which Ashara unexpectedly committed suicide by throwing herself off a cliff into the sea. The rumor was that Ashara didn't simply kill herself because her brother died in war (which happens to many women), but out of grief that her own lover had killed him. Catelyn asked Eddard about Ashara and Jon once early in their marriage: it was the only time Eddard ever truly became angry at her and frightened Catelyn. He said nothing, but commanded her never to ask about Ashara or about the identity of Jon's mother ever again, and indeed she never did afterwards. Even so this was only one of the more prominent of several rumors about the identity of Jon's mother. Others say that she was a fisherman's daughter in the Vale, where Eddard had been staying as a [[ward]] of [[Jon Arryn]] when the war broke out, and that he fathered Jon on her as he was fleeing back to the North to raise its armies after [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] killed his father and brother.\n\nAs in the TV series, the only woman that Ned himself ever identifies as Jon's mother is \"Wylla\" - only once, when Robert asked, and Eddard isn't in a position to refuse his king an answer. Ned also tells Robert that he does not want to discuss Wylla any further with him since his adultery was his dishonor towards himself and his wife.\n\nFollowing the revelation in the Season 6 finale of the TV series that Jon's parents were actually Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, it is unclear what role Wylla played in the events surrounding his birth. However, Wylla ''is'' confirmed to be a real person, in service to House Dayne. After leaving the Tower of Joy with the infant Jon, Eddard did first travel to House Dayne's castle-seat at Starfall, to return their ancestral sword Dawn which he took from Arthur Dayne after he died in their skirmish. Edric Dayne adamantly insisted that Wylla was a wetnurse to the infant Jon: apparently, Ned hired Wylla as a wetnurse and stayed at Starfall for some time until the baby Jon was large and strong enough for the long journey to Winterfell - and when pressed for what Jon's mother's name was, Eddard simply gave the name of Jon's ''nurse'', confident that her obscurity, low birth, and geographic distance from Winterfell and King's Landing would protect her from reprisal or investigation.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Template:Dayne navbox}}\n\n[[de:Wylla]]\n[[fr:Wylla]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Dayne]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

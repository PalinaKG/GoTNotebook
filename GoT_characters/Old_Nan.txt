She is a retired servant of [[House Stark]] known for her tale-telling abilities. She has entertained the children of [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] and [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] with stories throughout their childhoods.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nAfter [[Catelyn Stark]] leaves for King's Landing, Old Nan sits by [[Bran Stark]]'s bedside to watch him. She suggests the story of [[Duncan the Tall]] and Bran replies that he hates her stories \u2014 he prefers the scary ones. She retorts that he is a ''\"sweet summer child\"'' who knows nothing about fear, and tells him that fear is for the winter and for the Long Night, a winter season thousand of years ago that lasted a generation, in which those who didn't freeze to death had to face the [[White Walkers]], who ventured south for the first time and swept through Westeros.<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref> [[Theon Greyjoy]] interrupts another story and says that he would go mad if he was left alone with Old Nan.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\n[[File:Game-of-thrones-young-hodor.jpg|thumb|Bran sees Old Nan and Hodor in a vision.]]\nShe is seen in the vision by [[Bran Stark]], preventing [[Hodor]], named Wylis, from practicing with young [[Benjen Stark]], because Wylis is a stableboy and should not play with the nobles. [[Jon Snow]] and [[Sansa Stark]] later reminisce about the kidney pies Old Nan used to make for them as children.<ref>\"[[Book of the Stranger]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring Bran's frantic warging during the [[Battle at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven]], Nan is seen trying to help Wylis, in the throes of the seizure that ultimately robs him of his mind and leaves him unable to say anything except \"Hodor\".<ref>\"[[The Door]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|3=yes|4=yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances|2=note|5 = note}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Bran's vision\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBran and Old Nan 1x02.jpg|Old Nan telling [[Bran Stark]] a story.\nOld_Nan.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nActress Margaret John, who played Old Nan, passed away only two months before Season 1 began to air, though all of her scenes had already been completed. The character does appear during the second book, however, in the TV series canon the showrunners decided to retire the character out of respect.\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Old Nan is the oldest person living at Winterfell. She came to Winterfell to act as wetnurse for a Brandon Stark, which one is unsure, only that his mother had died birthing him. This Brandon Stark is believed to be either the brother of Lord Rickard Stark or a brother of his father. She's retired but tells stories and legends to the Stark children. She lost two sons in [[Robert's Rebellion]] and her grandson during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], while her daughters moved away and died. Her only surviving family is her great-grandson, the gentle, slow-witted [[Hodor]].\n\nIn the books, Bran recalls that his father [[Eddard Stark]] told him that she is so old that she was called \"Old\" Nan even before Eddard himself was a child.\n\nIn the books, it is Old Nan and not [[Osha]] who interprets the arrival of the [[Red Comet]] to mean the return of [[dragon]]s.\n\n\"Nan\" might be short for \"[[Nymeria]]\". When [[Arya Stark]] is on the run after escaping from [[King's Landing]], one of the aliases she uses is \"Nymeria\", but she says to call her \"Nan\" for short.\n\nAmong the stories she used to tell the Stark boys are:\n*The last hero - who fought the White Walkers in the [[Long Night]]\n*The [[ice dragon]]\n*[[Harrenhal]] and [[Harren the Black]]\n*The [[Night's King]]\n*Symeon Star-Eyes\n*How the [[Children of the Forest]] taught the [[First Men]] to send messages by raven\n*The [[Rat Cook]]\n*The Mad Axe\n*The Thing That Came In The Night\n\nFollowing the [[Sack of Winterfell]], Old Nan is brought to the [[Dreadfort]]. Her fate is unknown.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nan, Old}}\n[[de:Alte Nan]]\n[[fr:Vieille Nan]]\n[[pl:Stara Niania]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u044d\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u8001\u5976\u5988]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

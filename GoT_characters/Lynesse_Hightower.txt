She is the younger sister of [[Alerie Tyrell]], the wife of Lord [[Mace Tyrell]], head of [[House Tyrell]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nWhen [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] asks [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] the reason he had sold poachers into [[slavery]], he mentions Lynesse and her expensive tastes, which he always sought to please, leading to his ruin. Then Daenerys asks where is she now and he answers that she's in another place with [[Tregar Ormollen|another man]].<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lynesse is described as extremely beautiful with blonde hair and pale skin. Jorah Mormont says she looked a bit like Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nLynesse married Jorah after he won a tournament to celebrate the victory of King Robert against the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], in which Jorah wore her favor.\n\nLynesse was used to the riches and luxury of Oldtown, and found Bear Island primitive and crude. Jorah once brought her to Winterfell, and [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] noticed how unhappy she looked. She confessed to Catelyn that the North was no place for a Hightower of Oldtown. Catelyn tried to console Lynesse by telling her \"there was a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once, but in time she found much here she could love\", but in vain. \n\nJorah's attempts to please his wife led to him spending all of his money. He disgraced himself through behavior unbefitting a lord, by arresting poachers and selling them to slavers (slavery has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for millennia). When [[Eddard Stark]] came to arrest Jorah, he and Lynesse fled across the [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Free City]] of [[Lys]], leaving his aunt [[Maege Mormont|Maege]] to become the ruling Lady of Bear Island.\n\nJorah attempted to make his living as a sellsword, but was unable to provide an income acceptable to Lynesse. Eventually she left him and became a concubine to the merchant-lord [[Tregar Ormollen]].\n\nThe other Mormonts have a very negative opinion about Lynesse; [[Jeor Mormont|Jeor]] tells Jon that she was vain and, without her, Jorah would have never thought of selling poachers; Maege and Dacey regard Lynesse scornfully, as a weak woman whose soft hands were never made for axes.\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hightower navbox}}\n{{Mormont navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hightower, Lynesse}}\n\n[[de:Lynesse Hohenturm]]\n[[es:Lynesse Hightower]]\n[[zh:\u7433\u59ae\u4e1d\u00b7\u6d77\u5854\u5c14]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440]]\n[[Category:Exiles]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Mormont]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hightower]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

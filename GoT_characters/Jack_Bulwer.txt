He was originally from [[House Bulwer]] of [[Blackcrown]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nAlong with [[Kegs]] and [[Mully]], he travels to the [[Prostitution|brothel]] in [[Mole's Town]]. They sit drinking and listening to a [[Mole's Town whore|whore]] belching out the melodies to popular songs. Jack correctly guesses that she is belching ''[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]''. She compliments him on his hearing, but quips that it is a shame that he has a hangnail for a penis. They are later slaughtered when a group of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] led by [[Tormund]] and [[Styr]] [[Sack of Mole's Town|attack]] the village. News of their deaths soon reaches [[Castle Black]].<ref>\"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 4 appearances||||||||yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Black Jack Bulwer's background is the same.\n\nJack Bulwer\u00a0survives the [[Battle of Castle Black]].

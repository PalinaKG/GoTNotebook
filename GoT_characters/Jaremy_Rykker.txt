He is acting [[First Ranger]] when [[Benjen Stark]] is away from the [[Wall]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nSer Jaremy attends the induction of new recruits into the [[Night's Watch]]. He is the acting first ranger in the absence of [[Benjen Stark]] and summons the recruits assigned to the rangers after the [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander]]'s speech. He leads an escort for [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] when they go [[north of the Wall]] to take their vows in the [[Godswood]]. He embraces his newly sworn brothers after they take their vows. They discover the bodies of rangers [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]] near the Godswood and return them to [[Castle Black]]. The dead men had accompanied Benjen on his scouting mission beyond the Wall.<ref>\"[[You Win or You Die]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nFollowing the [[Breaching of the Wall]], Jaremy's fate remains unknown.<ref>\"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|7=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Jaremy is an officer in the rangers of the [[Night's Watch]]. Ser Jaremy attends the officers meeting with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and recalls being sent to the [[Wall]] by [[Tywin Lannister]] after fighting for [[House Targaryen]] in the [[Sack of King's Landing]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. It is Ser Jaremy rather than Ser Alliser who challenges Sam about his decision to take his vows in the Godswood. He is not named as being part of the escort to the Godswood. He identifies the bodies when they are returned to Castle Black.\n\nSer Jaremy and four other men were killed by the wight [[Jafer Flowers]]. Jaremy managed to hack the wight's head off, but was killed when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels.\n\nGive that Ser Jaremy is not shown to be killed in the episode, it is possible that he simply wasn't killed in the TV continuity.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rykker, Jaremy}}\n\n[[de:Jaremy Rykker]]\n[[fr:Jaremy Rykker]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0420\u0438\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:Knights|Rykker, Jaremy]]\n[[Category:House Rykker|Jaremy Rykker]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

The [[First Men]] under King [[Robar II Royce]] had defended their position with sharpened stakes. The Andal cavalry charged six times, but were unable to break the line, until the seventh attempt, when Torgold broke throught the First Men ranks, allowing the Andals to rush through the gap.<ref>\"[[Knights of the Vale]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Torgold Tellett was known as \"Torgold the Grim\", which was considered ironic as he was a larger-than-life personality who was known to ride into battle laughing and naked above the waist. He was a very large man who had a seven-pointed star carved across his chest and fought with an axe in each hand. Songs were written about him which claim that he knew no fear and felt no pain.\n\nHe fought under the leadership of Ser [[Artys Arryn|Artys I Arryn]] in the [[Battle of the Seven Stars]]. It has been claimed that although he was bleeding from a score of wounds he fought his way through Lord Redfort's strongest warriors and severed the lord's arm with a single cut. He was also said to have killed Ursula Upcliff by tearing her head off with his vare hands. He was killed by King [[Robar II Royce]], who slashed his head with [[Lady Forlorn]]. Tollett then laughed as he grabbed the blade, which sliced through his hands and buried itself in his skull. Songs claim that he died choking on his last laugh.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tollett, Torgold}}\n[[fr:Torgold Tallett]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0422\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0442]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:House Tollett]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Andals]]\n[[Category:Knights]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

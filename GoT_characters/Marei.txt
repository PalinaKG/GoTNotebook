Ellaria is delighted to see that Marei is \"not timid\". When Oberyn asks her if she likes women, Marei says that she does, as long as they look like Ellaria, prompting the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] [[paramour]] to compliment Marei's good taste. She begins kissing Ellaria, but they are interrupted when Oberyn storms out of the room to confront two [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers.<ref>\"[[Two Swords]]\"</ref>\n\nMarei later services Ellaria during a private orgy also involving Oberyn, Olyvar, and a [[Whore (The Warrior)|third prostitute]], possibly to celebrate the recent assassination of King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] at [[Purple Wedding|his own wedding]]. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] then interrupts, entering the room and saying he wants to discuss political matters with Oberyn in private - particularly, that he wants Oberyn to be a judge at his son Tyrion's [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]], and will give him a seat on the [[small council]] to ensure that Dorne continues to support Joffrey's younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]].

As of Season 6, following the death of [[Ros]] in Season 3, Marei became the longest recurring prostitute character in the series, both in total number of seasons and continuous seasons in a row. She appeared in eight episodes starting in Season 2, and for five continuous seasons through Season 6; she subsequently skipped Season 7 but then reappeared in Season 8. Ros did appear in more episodes overall (fourteen) and had more screentime, but she only appeared in three seasons (all in a row). Marei surpassed Ros as the longest recurring prostitute character in Season 5 - arguably Shae might be counted as recurring longer than Ros, with four continuous seasons, but she wasn't a character invented for the TV series. Either way, Marei's return in Season 6 meant she appeared in five continuous seasons of the TV series, also surpassing Shae's record.\n\nJosephine Gillan explained in an interview after Season 5 that for the episode \"Sons of the Harpy\", when the Faith Militant storm Littlefinger's brothel and drag Marei out of the building, it was originally planned that they would punch Marei in the face, so hard (possibly breaking Marei's nose or jaw) that Gillan was going to need to have a large amount of fake blood continuing to pour out of her mouth as she is dragged away. The production team later decided, however, that seeing a woman beaten up like this was too dark and violent for the needs of the scene, and just had her dragged away by her hair.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JinwSGyeZ78 Josephine Gillan interview, October 2015]</ref>\n\n:This wiki article does not contain many images of Marei, because she hasn't worn clothes in nearly all scenes she has appeared in - save briefly in the Season 4 premiere, before she again disrobes. The Wikia organization has staunch guidelines against posting images that feature nudity - ''Game of Thrones Wiki'' was contacted by Wikia Staff officers to enforce this policy. As a result, this article is mostly limited to headshots of Marei.\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a prostitute named Marei at Chataya's establishment. She is a fairly minor character, and apart from the name and the general fact that she is a prostitute in King's Landing, Marei in the TV series isn't particularly based on Marei from the books (in fact, the TV character was only given the name the season after she was introduced). Most of Marei's scenes so far in the TV series have no direct counterpart in the narrative of the novels. Nonetheless she is not, strictly speaking, a character ''entirely'' \"invented\" for the TV series the way Ros or Armeca were.\n\nMarei in the books has green eyes, porcelain skin, and silvery hair, but is also very solemn. She is also literate. While in the TV series Bronn celebrated being knighted by having sex with [[Mirelle]], in the books he celebrated by having sex with Marei and another prostitute named Alayaya, simultaneously. This occurred at the beginning of the third novel, and correspondingly, Bronn celebrated his knighthood by going to the brothel at the beginning of Season 3. Marei has not been mentioned in the novels afterwards.\n\nThere is a fan theory that Marei is [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s bastard daughter. She has blonde hair and green eyes like the Lannisters, and her age would put her birth during the years when Tywin was in the city as Hand of the King. Tyrion also notices that unlike most of the prostitutes in the brothel, she is literate - perhaps hinting that she's the bastard of a lord who cared about his illegitimate offspring enough, though at a distance, that he ordered the brothel owners to at least make sure she learned to read. [[George R.R. Martin]] was asked whether Tywin had any bastards (in general); his answer was \"He'd [Tywin] have you flogged for the mere suggestion\".<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Various_questions_concerning_Tywin_Oberyn_Gregor_the_North_and_Sansa/ So Spake Martin, April 15, 2008]</ref> \n\nIn the TV series, Tyrion pronounces her name \"Muh-ray\" (with a short A), as opposed to \"Mare-ay\" (that is, with a long A).\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n* {{AWOIAF|Marei/Theories}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[de:Marei]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435\u044f]]\n[[fr:Marei]]\n[[ro:Marei (serial)]]\n[[pt-br:Marei]]\n[[Category:Prostitutes]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

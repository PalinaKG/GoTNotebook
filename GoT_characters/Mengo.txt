Which they were. But Khal Mengo had united all of them into one khalasar with one aim. To trample the world beneath their hooves and take other peoples as their herd. One by one, the cities of the Tall Men were overwelmed|[[Jorah Mormont]]|The Dothraki}}\nKhal '''Mengo''' was a [[Dothraki]] [[Khal]] during the [[Century of Blood]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the Century of Blood, Mengo united the Dothraki into a single [[khalasar]] for the purpose of conquering the [[Known world|world]] and all its peoples. During his reign, his khalasar conquered many of the cities of [[Kingdom of Sarnor]] and largely wiped out the [[Sarnori]]. Mengo was succeeded by his son, [[Moro (son of Mengo)|Moro]].<ref>\"[[The Dothraki]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Mengo united all of the [[Dothraki]] tribes and [[khalasar]]s under the guidance of his mother Doshi and became the first great [[khal]], enslaving and killing any who refused to follow him. In his later years he moved against the [[Kingdom of Sarnor]]. The [[Sarnori]] looked down on the Dothraki and attempted to convince the horselords to fight for them by bribing them with gifts such as gold and slaves. Mengo took the gifts and then burned the fields, towns and farms that the Sarnori had built. The Dothraki consider it a sin to cut the flesh of the earth with plows, spades and axes, hence they wished to return the [[Dothraki Sea]] to its former state.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Mengo]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u043e]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Khals]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

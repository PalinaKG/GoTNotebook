She was previously married to [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Tion Lannister]]. She died in the [[Reyne Rebellion]] along with both of her houses.\n\n==Biography==\nEllyn Reyne was [[Marriage|betrothed]] to Ser [[Tywald Lannister]], but following his death she seduced his twin brother [[Tion Lannister|Tion]], despite him having already promised to marry another woman. He was later killed in battle and she attempted to seduce the heir to [[Casterly Rock]], [[Tytos Lannister]], who refused her and informed his wife [[Jeyne Lannister|Jeyne]]. As punishment, Ellyn was forced to marry Lord [[Walderan Tarbeck]] of the failing [[House Tarbeck]].\n\nLady Ellyn returned to extravagant wealth when her brothers [[Roger Reyne|Roger]] and [[Reynard Reyne|Reynard]] acquired a loan from the naive Tytos. Lord Walderan was imprisoned in a dungeon in [[Casterly Rock]] by [[Tywin Lannister]] upon his return from the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]] and Lady Ellyn protested by threatening war. Tytos released Walderan and declared peace with House Tarbeck.\n\nThe following year, Tywin summoned the Reynes and Tarbecks to Casterly Rock and they rose in revolt. Once Tywin's army reached [[Tarbeck Hall]], Lady Ellyn closed the gates and sent [[raven]]s to her brothers at [[Castamere]], though before they could arrive Tywin raised trebuchets and brought down the keep within hours, crushing Lady Ellyn and her son [[Tion Tarbeck|Tion]] to death.<ref>\"[[The Rains of Castamere (Histories & Lore)|The Rains of Castamere]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ellyn Reyne was a strong-willed, hot-tempered and ambitious woman who dreamed of marrying into [[House Lannister]] and becoming the Lady of [[Casterly Rock]]. [[House Reyne]]'s wealth and position allowed her father Robert to arrange her betrothal to Ser [[Tywald Lannister]], though both her father and betrothed were killed in the Peake Uprising in 233 AC. She then seduced the new heir, [[Tion Lannister]], who was already betrothed to a daughter of [[House Rowan]]. Lord [[Gerold Lannister]] opposed the match due to how quickly she had acted following Robert and Tywald's death, but allowed his son to follow his heart.\n\nEllyn married Tion in 235 AC and became a rival of [[Tytos Lannister]]'s wife [[Jeyne Lannister|Jeyne]]. She hosted extravagant events and used her position to empower [[House Reyne]], including giving positions of power to her relatives. Her husband died in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion, making Tytos the heir to Casterly Rock. Jeyne surpassed Ellyn in influence as a result of this, and Ellyn made an unsuccessful attempt to seduce Tytos to remedy this. When Tytos told Jeyne what Ellyn had done, she was quick to inform her father-in-law, who acted swiftly.\n\nEllyn was then forced to marry Lord [[Walderan Tarbeck]], with whom she had two daughters, Rohanne and Cyrelle, and a son, Tion. The rivalry between Ellyn and Jeyne was dubbed the \"War of the Wombs\" by Lord Toad, the [[fool]] of Casterly Rock. Ellyn was present at the betrothal of Genna Lannister and Emmon Frey, and found it amusing as she did not consider them a good match. She used the wealth of [[House Lannister]] to rebuild [[Tarbeck Hall]].\n\n[[Tywin Lannister]] demanded that [[House Reyne]] and [[House Tarbeck]] repay their debts to Casterly Rock and imprisoned Walderan when he attempted to intimidate Tytos. Ellyn took two members of [[House Lannister of Lannisport]] as well as Ser [[Stafford Lannister]], the brother of Tywin's betrothed [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]], hostage in response to this. She threatened to kill them if Walderan was harmed, and Tytos agreed to an exchange despite Tywin advising his father to send Lord Tarbeck back in three pieces.\n\nEllyn was killed in 261 AC along with her son Tion when Tywin had their keep attacked with trebuchets.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Reyne, Ellyn}}\n<!--InterWiki links-->\n[[de:Ellyn Regn]]\n[[fr:Ellyn Reyne]]\n[[es:Ellyn Reyne]]\n[[it:Ellyn Reyne]]\n[[nl:Ellyn Reyn]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0420\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u827e\u83b2\u00b7\u96f7\u8036\u65af]]\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Reyne]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tarbeck]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

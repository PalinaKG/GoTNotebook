She is the Lady of [[Barrowton]].\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nWhen [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] calls out [[Arya Stark|Arya]] on her speech not being like that of a lowborn, she lies saying that her mother was a handmaid to Lady Dustin and taught her how to speak properly.<ref>\"[[A Man Without Honor]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Barbrey Ryswell is the head of House Dustin and the widow of Lord Willam Dustin, who fought alongside [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]] until he was killed in the [[Showdown at the Tower of Joy]]. Lord [[Roose Bolton]] was married to her late eldest sister, Bethany. It isn't clear if Willam left an heir, because Lady Barbrey continues to rule House Dustin in his name. She usually leads House Dustin to act in concert with House Ryswell, which is still ruled by her own father Rodrik Ryswell.\n\nLady Dustin has wrinkles around her mouth and eyes, but she is still tall, unbent and handsome. Her hair is equal parts brown and grey, wearing it tied behind her head in a widow's knot. She usually dresses all in black, but she sometimes accentuates her attire with vair. While she is intelligent, she has grown into a bitter woman over the years, among other things due to her husband's death.\n\nIn her youth, Lady Dustin was infatuated with [[Brandon Stark (son of Rickard)|Brandon Stark]], who took her maidenhead. She claims Brandon loved her and never wanted to marry [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and that the match was made when Lord [[Rickard Stark]]'s [[Order of Maesters|maester]], Walys, put the idea in Rickard's head. Lady Dustin is extremely distrustful of maesters in general and refers to them as grey rats.\n\nLady Dustin was quite fond of her nephew [[Domeric Bolton|Domeric]], and as such loathes his bastard half-brother [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay]] openly, whom she suspects had a hand in the former's death. She keeps referring to Ramsay as \"the Bastard\", presumably because she knows how much it angers him. Ramsay dislikes Lady Dustin and has malicious intentions toward her, but his father forbids him to harm her, as after the [[Red Wedding]], she is one of the few truly loyal vassals [[House Bolton]] has.\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Lord Willam was among those who were summoned by Eddard Stark. Lady Dustin begged her husband to send any of his kin in his stead, but he was too proud to let anyone else lead the Barrowton levies. Eddard returned Lord Willam's horse to Lady Dustin, and told her that Willam had died an honorable death, that his body had been laid to rest beneath the red mountains of Dorne.\n\nEver since, Lady Dustin holds a grudge against Eddard, even after his demise, for not bringing her husband's bones north with him so she could bury him at his ancestral home. She intends to pay him back by feeding his bones (which, in contrast to the show, have not been brought yet to Winterfell) to her dogs. Her hatred towards House Stark is not limited to Eddard, as she states \"''All my favorite Starks are dead''\".\n\nWhen [[Robb Stark]] summons his bannermen, Lady Dustin has no wish to reinforce the Starks, but sends as few men as she dares - knowing that she must give Robb some or risk the wrath of Winterfell. She also uses that to her advantage: her men keep her informed about the location of Ned's bones.\n\nLady Dustin is one of the guests at Ramsay's wedding. She, not Ramsay, tells [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] he should give [[Jeyne Poole|the bride]] away because he is the closest thing she has for a brother. It is unclear whether Lady Dustin is aware of \"Arya Stark\"'s true identity, but if she suspects the ruse, she is wise enough to keep her doubts to herself.\n\nLady Dustin has a keen sense of observation: during the wedding, she notices that Roose does not touch any of the meals or the drinks, unless [[Wyman Manderly|Lord Manderly]] tastes them first; she also notices that Lord Manderly behaves too joyfully, maybe suspiciously, for someone who must feast with [[Wendel Manderly|his son]]'s murderers - and serves [[Frey pie|the meat pies]] himself to the Boltons and [[House Frey|Freys]] (she has no idea about the true contents of the pies, though). She knows well that Lord Manderly would have turned against the Boltons and Freys had he been brave enough, and that many of the other guests who lost their kin at the Red Wedding - the [[House Umber|Umbers]], [[House Hornwood|Hornwoods]], [[House Flint|Flints]], [[House Cerwyn|Cerwyns]], [[House Tallhart|Tallharts]], Slates - would have done the same, since \"the north remembers\".\n\nSome time after the wedding, Lady Dustin and Reek go down to the crypts. There she reveals to him why she hates the Starks, and warns him not to repeat what she said. They notice that several swords are missing from the statues, but they cannot guess the reason.\n\nLady Dustin disapproves of Ramsay's cruelty toward his wife, claiming that \"Lady Arya\u2019s sobs do us more harm than all of Lord Stannis\u2019s swords and spears. If the Bastard means to remain Lord of Winterfell, he had best teach his wife to laugh\". She is also, like many of the northern Houses, contemptuous of Roose's allies in [[House Frey]], as a large number of the soldiers she sent with Robb Stark died at the Red Wedding.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dustin, Barbrey}}\n\n[[pl:Barbrey Dustin]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0440\u0438 \u0414\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d]]\n[[Category:House Dustin|Barbrey]]\n[[Category:House Ryswell|Barbrey]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

The family tree also records his wife, [[Darlessa Marbrand]], and his son, [[Tyrek Lannister]].<ref name=\"finalebook\" />\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tygett's genealogy and relation to the other Lannisters is the same. Though he is the youngest brother per the season 8 prop's genealogy, he is the second-youngest in the book series, older than Gerion. \n\nTygett had a stormy relationship with his oldest brother, Tywin, who overshadowed all of his siblings, but he was kind to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. Whereas [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] has always been obedient and loyal to Tywin, and Gerion almost feuded with him, Tygett tried to become independent of him and his own man, but he never matched Tywin, which made him angrier as the years went by. \n\nTygett died of a pox some years before the beginning point of the series. He was survived by his only son Tyrek, who served as a squire for King [[Robert Baratheon]], alongside his cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He mysteriously disappeared at the [[Riot of King's Landing]], and his body was never found.\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Tygett}}\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

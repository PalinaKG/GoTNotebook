When mother dies my sister gets the castle because she's older.|[[Lollys Stokeworth]] to [[Bronn]]|The House of Black and White}}\n'''Tanda Stokeworth''' is the [[Lord of Stokeworth|Lady of Stokeworth]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\nBronn mistakenly believes that he and his betrothed [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]] will one day reside at [[Castle Stokeworth]]. Lollys corrects him by saying that when her mother dies her older sister [[Falyse Stokeworth|Falyse]] will inherit the castle. She also tells him that Falyse pulls her hair when their mother is not looking.<ref>\"[[The House of Black and White]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Stokeworth family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tanda Stokeworth is the Lady of Stokeworth. She is very old, and known to not be a very bright or attractive woman.\n\nTanda is the head of House Stokeworth in the novels. When House Stokeworth was first mentioned in the TV series in Season 4's \"[[Mockingbird]]\", a point of some confusion was that Tyrion said that Lollys's older sister would inherit Castle Stokeworth after their ''father'' died. When Lollys first appeared on-screen in Season 5, however, she made it clear that her older sister will inherit the castle after their ''mother'' dies. It is possible that the TV writers thought that having a female head of a major House would be confusing and require some sort of lengthy explanation, so they simply pushed back the explanation about Lollys's mother being the actual head of the House to Season 5. It can easily be explained that Tyrion was simply mistaken or misspoke.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]], Manly Stokeworth was Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]]. He was succeeded in the position by [[Janos Slynt]]. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] remarked that the widowed Lady Tanda has no love for the Lannisters: it is quite possible that Manly was in fact her husband, and that he died during the [[Sack of King's Landing]] committed by Tywin's army.\n\nUnable to find a husband for her daughter Lollys, she made several attempts to convince Littlefinger to marry Lollys by serving him extravagant meals. Littlefinger had no intention of marrying Lollys, finding her to be bad company as well as overweight and unattractive. She later makes similar attempts with [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], with him repeatedly trying to avoid the invitations.\n\nOnce the [[War of the Five Kings]] breaks out, Tanda and Lord [[Gyles Rosby]] provide half of the food still in arriving [[King's Landing]] as their lands lie close to the city to the north and are still untouched by war.\n\nAlong with her daughters, Tanda attends several significant events in King's Landing such as [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s nameday celebration, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s departure for [[Dorne]] (after which the [[Riot of King's Landing]] takes place, in which Lollys is gang raped and impregnated) and the [[Purple Wedding]]. During the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], they take shelter with the other women in [[Maegor's Holdfast]].\n\nAfter Tywin's death, Tanda suggests naming Lollys's child after him, as she claims to have admired him above all other men. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] is disgusted by the notion that he father's name would be given to a [[Bastardy|bastard]] born of rape. This subplot was omitted from the TV series, in which Lollys was never raped.\n\nIn the fourth book, Tanda suffers a severe accident, falling from her horse when her saddle girth snaps, causing her to break her hip in the fall. A stable boy is beaten for not noticing the saddle girth was worn and liable to break, but it is implied Bronn might have engineered the accident to accelerate his own plans.\n\nFalyse and her husband attempt to kill Bronn, at Cersei's request. The plot fails, Bronn kills\u00a0Falyse's husband and expels her from Castle Stokeworth.\u00a0Falyse tells Cersei what happened, wondering\u00a0what will become of her\u00a0mother now. Cersei thinks that Tanda might very well be dead already, as Bronn doesn't seem the type of man who would bother putting\u00a0much effort into nursing an old woman with a broken hip.\n\nSome time later it is reported that\u00a0Tanda has\u00a0died\u00a0of a chill in the chest, brought on by her injury.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stokeworth navbox}}\n[[de:Tanda Schurwerth]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u5766\u59b2\u00b7\u53f2\u94ce\u514b\u6e25\u65af]]\n[[fr:Tanda Castelfoyer]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stokeworth, Tanda}}\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:House Stokeworth]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Ruling ladies]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

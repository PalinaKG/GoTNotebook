As Tywin's first cousin, she was a Lannister before her marriage.\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nJoanna was the wife of [[Tywin Lannister]], the head of [[House Lannister]] and the [[Lord of Casterly Rock]]. Joanna was perhaps the only person Tywin loved unconditionally. Joanna bore him the twins [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]].

At one point she bitterly says that he is funny, but nothing will ever match his first joke: killing her mother in childbirth when he came out of her. The greatest joke of all is that she had to die so something as worthless as him could live. Tyrion is hurt and coldly reminds her that she was his mother too.<ref name=\"E12\"/>\n\nJoanna's brother, [[Stafford Lannister]], is briefly mentioned by [[Lancel Lannister]] as having been killed at the [[Battle of Oxcross]].<ref>\"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]\"</ref>\n\nCersei explains to [[Sansa Stark]] that when she was four and her mother died, she prayed for days hoping the gods would give her mother back until her father explained that prayer could not do that.<ref name=\"E19\" />\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Tyrion (who was seriously injured in the battle but recovered) came to his father in the [[Tower of the Hand]]. He asked that as a basic reward for loyal service, his father grant him rule of [[Casterly Rock]] itself, given that Tywin would be remaining in King's Landing as [[Hand of the King]]. Tyrion pointed out that by all laws it was his right, given that his older brother Jaime forswore all right to inheritance when he joined the [[Kingsguard]]. Tywin refuses and when Tyrion asks why, he launches into a bitter tirade saying that he shouldn't need to explain something so obvious: Tyrion's mother died so he could enter the world, and on top of that he is a stunted [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] whose very existence is a shame to their family. Tywin always hated Tyrion for \"killing\" his beloved wife.<ref>\"[[Valar Dohaeris]]\"</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Red Wedding]], Tyrion confronts Tywin after a Small Council meeting about his plans to force Tyrion to impregnate [[Sansa Stark]], which he says is for the good of the Lannister family. Tyrion counters by demanding to know when Tywin ever did something \"for the family\", putting the family's interests above and at the expense of his own. Wounded and choking back anger, Tywin bluntly declares that the day Tyrion was born and his mother died in childbirth, he was so stricken with grief that he wanted to carry Tyrion into the sea and let him drown but stayed his hand because Tyrion is a Lannister and Tywin refused to become a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]]. Therefore, he earnestly believes that Tyrion should be outright grateful for this as if it were a deep personal sacrifice: that Tywin refrained from killing his own infant son.<ref>\"[[Mhysa]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\n\nWhen Tyrion demands a [[trial by combat]] to prove his innocence in the [[Purple Wedding|killing]] of his nephew, King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], he is visited by [[Oberyn Martell]], who regales him with a tale of their first encounter when Tyrion was just a baby, and how even then Cersei showed her hatred for Tyrion as she irrationally blamed him for Joanna's death.<ref>\"[[Mockingbird]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen Jaime shows his disgust with Cersei for having Tyrion falsely convicted and sentenced to die for killing their son Joffrey, Cersei irrationally justifies her actions on the grounds that he killed their mother too, which exasperates Jaime even more.

First cousin marriage is not uncommon among the nobility in Westeros, and apparently isn't considered [[Incest|incest]] in their culture. She was the sister of\u00a0Ser [[Stafford Lannister]], who was later killed during the War of the Five Kings by Robb Stark's army.\n\nThough Tywin was always a stern and ruthless man, Joanna was said to bring out what little warmth he had, and he was even known to smile in her presence. Tywin and Joanna were very deeply in love, and thus Tywin took her death very hard. He became even more stern and was never known to smile again. Her death also fueled his senseless hatred for his younger son Tyrion, whom he blamed for killing her, combined with the shame he brought on their House for being born a dwarf.\n\nTywin later wanted to force all of his children into marriage-alliances to benefit House Lannister (as Cersei was later married off to King Robert), and he was offended that Tyrion risked such a future marriage alliance for himself by marrying a commoner for love when he was young ([[Tysha]]). The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin ''himself'' married for love when he wed his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another powerful noble family. As a minor Lannister cousin, Joanna brought no new alliances, lands, or wealth with her when she married Tywin.\n\nAccording to [[Barristan Selmy]], [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] lusted after Joanna. At the wedding of Tywin and Joanna, Aerys drunkenly japed about how it was a pity the First Night tradition was banned and took too many liberties during Joanna's [[bedding]]. Tywin was not amused, and that caused further friction between him and Aerys. At the feast to celebrate Aerys's tenth year on the Iron Throne, Aerys drunkenly asked Joanna if nursing twins had ruined her breasts, deeply upsetting Joanna and offending Tywin to the point he tried to resign as Hand of the King. After Joanna died giving birth to Tyrion, Aerys was heard saying the gods had done so to teach Tywin some humility, which further enraged the already grieving Tywin when the king's words reached Casterly Rock.\n\nAccording to the books, Cersei and Jaime were eight or nine years old when their mother died, while in the TV series Cersei said she was four years old.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Joanna}}\n\n\n[[de:Joanna Lennister]]\n[[es:Joanna Lannister]]\n[[fr:Joanna Lannister]]\n[[it:Joanna Lannister]]\n[[pl:Joanna Lannister]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n[[sv:Joanna Lannister]]\n[[zh:\u4e54\u5b89\u5a1c\u00b7\u5170\u5c3c\u65af\u7279]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

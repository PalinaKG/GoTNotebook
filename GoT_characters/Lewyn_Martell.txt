A younger son, he joined the elite Kingsguard, forswearing any claim to land and title.\n\nHis niece Elia wed the [[Prince of Dragonstone]], [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], with whom the Martells shared blood due to intermarriage a century earlier, and bore him [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|two]] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|children]].<ref>\"[[House Martell (Histories & Lore)]]\"</ref> However, Rhaegar later allegedly [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] [[Lyanna Stark]], a false tale that led to the [[execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark]], Lyanna's father and brother, and ignited [[Robert's Rebellion]].<ref name=\"oberyn\"/><ref name=\"barristan\"/>\n\nEven though Rhaegar dishonored his niece by running off with Lyanna, Prince Lewyn kept his oath and followed Rhaegar as he rode to face the rebel army led by [[Robert Baratheon]] at the climactic [[Battle of the Trident]]. Lewyn perished in the battle, along with Rhaegar and thousands of other Dornishmen.<ref name=\"oberyn\"/><ref name=\"barristan\"/>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Martell family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lewyn Martell is remembered fondly by his family as a kind man who loved his extended family. The Kingsguard are forbidden to marry or even to love, and in the past several have been severely punished even for having sexual affairs. As per the customs of Dorne, however, Prince Lewyn continued to secretly keep a [[Paramour|paramour]]. Ser Barristan and the other Kingsguard were aware of it but kept his secret, as he did not let it interfere with his duty.\n\nLewyn joined the Kingsguard in part because he was the younger sibling in his generation of House Martell. He was actually the eldest son, but rule passed to his older sister (mother of Doran, Elia, and Oberyn) due to Dorne's gender-blind inheritance laws, different from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nAt the Battle of the Trident, Prince Lewyn led the large Dornish contingent (10,000 men strong) which threatened to break Robert Baratheon's left flank. During the fighting he became badly wounded, however, and in the confusion Ser Lyn Corbray led a counter-charge by the rebels, in which he personally dueled and killed Lewyn Martell. The vain and arrogant Ser Lyn would in later years boast about how he had personally defeated Prince Lewyn, though in reality Prince Lewyn was already very badly wounded (perhaps mortally so) and Corbray simply finished him off.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{MadKingKingsguard}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martell, Lewyn}}\n[[de:Lewyn Martell]]\n[[es:Lewyn Martell]]\n[[it:Lewyn Martell]]\n[[nl:Lewyn Martel]]\n[[pl:Lewyn Martell]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b]]\n[[zh:\u52d2\u6587\u00b7\u9a6c\u6cf0\u5c14]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard of Aerys II Targaryen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

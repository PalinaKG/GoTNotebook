But before I arrived, a loyal knight smuggled them across the Narrow Sea to safety.|[[Stannis Baratheon]]|Robert's Rebellion (Histories & Lore)}}\nSer '''Willem Darry''' was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Darry]] who remained loyal to [[House Targaryen]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]].\n\n==Biography==\nFollowing the [[Sack of King's Landing]] and the birth of [[Daenerys Targaryen]], Ser Willem smuggled [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] across the [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Free Cities]] before [[Stannis Baratheon]] arrived to seize [[Dragonstone]].<ref>\"[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories & Lore)|Robert's Rebellion]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Willem Darry was the [[master-at-arms]] at the [[Red Keep]] and the brother of Ser [[Jonothor Darry]] of the Kingsguard. He was a grey bear of a man who was half-blind. He had a gruff, kind voice and big wrinkled hands, soft as old leather. Daenerys has fond memories of Ser Willem, noting that while the servants were terrified of him bellowing orders at them, he was always kind to her.\n\nAfter the Mad King's death in the Sack of King's Landing and Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]]'s death during labor, the garrison of Dragonstone considered selling Viserys and the infant Daenerys to the new king. However, before they could come to a decision, Ser Willem and four loyal men smuggled Viserys and Daenerys from the island and fled to safety in [[Braavos]]. However, Ser Willem was old and some years later he became sick and died, leaving Viserys and Daenerys to fend for themselves.\n\nIn \"''A Feast for Crows''\" and \"''A Dance with Dragons''\", it is revealed Ser Willem and [[Doran Martell]] signed a secret pact of alliance between Dorne and House Targaryen in Braavos. The alliance was to be sealed by a marriage between Viserys and Princess Arianne Martell. Ser Willem never told Viserys (nor Daenerys) about the pact. Viserys died unaware, and Daenerys only learns of it many years later when Quentyn Martell arrives at her court in Meereen to propose a marriage between the two of them, given that Viserys is dead.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darry, Willem}}\n[[ru:\u0423\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0438]]\n[[fr:Willem Darry]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:House Darry|Willem Darry]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

He is traveling the [[Kingsroad]] following the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nKurleket is drinking with companions at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrives on his way south. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is also in the inn. She turns to the knights from the [[Riverlands]] to help her to arrest Tyrion, accusing him of attempting to murder [[Bran Stark|Bran]]. She asserts her origin as a daughter of [[House Tully]], and then tells Kurleket that she recognizes the red stallion of [[House Bracken]] and says that her father, Lord [[Hoster Tully]] of [[Riverrun]], considers Lord [[Jonos Bracken]] one of his most loyal bannermen. Kurleket draws his sword and threatens Tyrion.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Tyrion in the inn.png|thumb|Kurleket holds his sword on Tyrion Lannister at the Crossroads Inn.]]\nKurleket is among the men who accompany Catelyn into the Vale. The party is attacked by warriors from the [[hill tribes]], and Kurleket dies defending Catelyn.<ref>\"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|4=yes|5=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, three men-at-arms from House Bracken accompany Catelyn into the Vale. Kurleket is the leader of the trio, and he is the one who speaks to Catelyn in the inn. He assists in capturing Tyrion and is among the party that travels into the Mountains of the Moon. He is slain during a battle with the Mountain clans.\n\nKurleket's name is an inside joke by author [[George R.R. Martin]]. All three men from House Bracken whom Catelyn recruits at the Crossroads Inn are named \"Mohor\", \"Lharys\", and \"Kurleket\" - as in Moe, Larry, and Curly, the infamous [[Wikipedia:The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]]. Martin has himself confirmed the reference.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Category/C91/ So Spake Martin, March 10, 2006]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Bracken navbox}}\n[[de:Kurleket]]\n[[fr:Kurleket]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0443\u0440\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0435\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u5e93\u96f7\u51ef\u7279]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Bracken]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

He joined forces with the [[Stark]] [[King in the North|King of Winter]], [[Brandon Stark (the Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] and together they [[Fall of the Night's King|brought down]] the Night's King.<ref>\"[[The Night's Watch]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\n\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Joramun is a legendary [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] who not only fought the Night's King, but also blew the Horn of Winter to wake [[giants]] from the earth.\n\nAccording to [[Mance Rayder]] and [[Ygritte]], the Horn is also capable of bringing the [[Wall]] down, but that was never mentioned in the original legend.\n\nGiven that the Night's King was only the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he and Joramun lived relatively soon after the Wall was completed - which ''may'' imply that Joramun was the very first King-Beyond-the-Wall, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nWhen [[Jon Snow]] comes to [[parley]] with Mance Rayder (actually to kill him), Mance shows him a huge horn, claiming it is the legendary Horn of Winter. He tells Jon to deliver an ultimatum to [[Castle Black]]: unless the wildlings are allowed to pass the Wall within three days, he will blow the horn and destroy the Wall. The horn is destroyed while Mance is executed. However, later Tormund tells Jon that the destroyed horn was a fake; Mance has never found the true horn. There is a theory that the [[Old warhorn|broken warhorn]] which Sam has in possession is the Horn of Winter, but it has not been verified so far.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{KingsBeyondTheWall}}\n{{LegendaryHeroes}}\n\n[[fr:Joramun]]\n[[de:Joramun]]\n[[zh:\u4e54\u66fc]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0443\u043d]]\n[[Category:Kings-Beyond-the-Wall]]\n[[Category:Free Folk]]\n[[Category:Legendary figures]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

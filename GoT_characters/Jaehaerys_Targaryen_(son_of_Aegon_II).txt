He presumably had a very close relationship with his mother. When his cousin [[Lucerys Velaryon]] was killed by Jaehaerys's uncle [[Aemond Targaryen]], Lucerys's stepfather/great-uncle [[Daemon Targaryen]], who was also Jaehaerys's great-uncle, hired two assassins to kill Aegon's and Helaena's children. One was a former \"[[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloak]]\" known as [[Blood]] and the other was a rat-catcher known as [[Cheese]] who knew all the sewers around [[King's Landing]]. This meant that they both had perfect recognition of the layout of the [[Red Keep]]. After breaking into the royal apartments, they found Helaena putting her children to bed. They demanded a son for a son. Helaena pleaded they kill her instead, but they refused. She named Jaehaerys's younger brother Maelor as the victim. However, Cheese just told Maelor that his mother wanted him dead, and some believe that Helaena named Maelor because Jaehaerys was heir to the [[Iron Throne]], or because Maelor was just too young to understand. This request became an act of defiance against the [[Greens]], as Blood just beheaded Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time the guards came, the Queen was cradling her son's body. Jaehaerys's death would eventually led to his mother's insanity and suicide.<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n== In the books ==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n| Spoiler =\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jaehaerys Targaryen was born in 123 AC and was larger and healthier than his twin sister [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]], but was born with six fingers of his left and six toes on each foot. A [[dragon]] egg was placed in his cradle, which hatched into [[Shrykos]]. In the same year, two of Jaehaerys's half-siblings were born - a boy to a [[whore]] in the Street of Silk and a girl to one of Queen [[Alicent Hightower]]'s maidservants. Jaehaerys's trueborn brother [[Maelor Targaryen|Maelor]] was born in 127 AC. In 129 AC, Jaehaerys and his siblings were brought to visit their grandfather King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] on his deathbed, where he entertained them with a fictional story about their great-great-grandfather King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], in which he flew on north of the [[Wall]] on his dragon to fight against [[wildlings]], [[giants]] and [[warg]]s.\n\nShortly after the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon]] was killed by Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] in the [[Dance Over Storm's End]]. Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] hired the former [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloak]] [[Blood]] and the rat-catcher [[Cheese]] to murder one of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]'s sons in retaliation. As Queen [[Helaena Targaryen]] brought her children to her mother's chambers in the [[Tower of the Hand]], which she did on a nightly basis, the two men ambushed them. The men ordered the queen to choose which of her sons would die. She offered herself, but they refused and she tearfully chose Maelor, whom she deemed too young to understand the situation. Blood decapitated Jaehaerys instead and the two men fled with the prince's head.\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Targaryen navbox}}\n}}\n[[de:Jaehaerys Targaryen (Sohn von Aegon II.)]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u0445\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d (\u0441\u044b\u043d \u042d\u0439\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430 II)]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Jaehaerys (son of Aegon 2)}}\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Greens]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

She is considered dim-witted.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\n[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] arranges for a marriage between Lollys and Ser [[Bronn]] of the Blackwater, to sway the ambitious ex-[[Mercenary|sellsword]] from [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s service. Though her older sister [[Falyse Stokeworth|Falyse]] is heir to [[Castle Stokeworth]], she is forty years old and barren, and Bronn suggests to Tyrion that she may suffer an \"accident\" in time, making Lollys the sole heir. Tyrion comments that Lollys is dim-witted, but it does not bother Bronn.<ref>\"[[Mockingbird]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\nLollys is enjoying a walk with her betrothed Bronn outside of Castle Stokeworth, while discussing their upcoming wedding. She also confesses to Bronn how her sister Falyse is mean to her and will not let the couple live at Stokeworth when their mother dies. Bronn comforts Lollys, asserting that in his experience, mean people will always get what they deserve. \n\nThe two are interrupted by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. He tells Bronn that Cersei has broken her agreement with him, and Lollys will instead marry Ser [[Wyllis Bracken]]. Bronn is very displeased. Jaime orders him to come with him to [[Dorne]], and when they return - Bronn will be rewarded with a better wife and castle.<ref>\"[[The House of Black and White]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 5 appearances||yes|||||||||}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Stokeworth family tree}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBronn and Lollys.jpg|Bronn and Lollys.\nLollys-promo.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lollys's\u00a0background is the same. However, she is a fairly regular background character during the course of the first three books. She is morbidly obese, has dull brown eyes\u00a0which always seem to be wet with tears, and is considered [[lackwit|simple]]. In addition, she is second in line for the inheritance of House Stokeworth's lands and titles, so there are no suitors for her hand; her mother, Lady Tanda, is desperate to find a match for her, even relentlessly pursuing Tyrion for a time.\n\nThere is no mention in the novels that Lollys used to be bullied by\u00a0her sister.\n\nLollys is a victim in the [[Riot of King's Landing]], where she is ambushed and gang-raped by fifty men in [[Flea Bottom]], which results in her pregnancy with a [[bastard]] child. After this, she is considered defiled and is left a social pariah at court. This makes her an ideal match for Bronn, who as an \"upjumped cutthroat\" is also considered too low for suitable noble matches, yet now their circumstances have met in the middle.\n\n[[Shae]], while acting as secret mistress to Tyrion during his stint as Hand of the King, served a time as hand-maiden to Lollys, before coming into [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]'s service following her marriage to Tyrion. She tells Tyrion discontentedly that Lollys sleeps and eats all day, and sometimes she falls asleep while she\u2019s eating, then the food falls under the blankets and Shae has to clean her. Shae knows that Lollys was gang-raped, but has no sympathy for her.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Lollys stays with her mother and sister in the [[Red Keep]]. They are invited by Cersei to seek refuge with her in the Queen's Ballroom at [[Maegor's Holdfast]]. When they are about to cross the drawbridge, Lollys becomes frightened and refuses to cross, clutches at Shae and sobbing, \"I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to.\" Sansa notices that Shae looks as if she wants to shove Lollys into the dry moat, onto the iron spikes. Sansa speaks softly to Lollys and tries to calm her, but to no avail. Finally, Shae and Falyse grab Lollys by her elbows, and drag her across the bridge. Sansa feels sorry for Lollys, knowing about her rape and pregnancy. While they dine at the fort, Lollys sits hunched and shivering;\u00a0she eats too fast, gets sick, and retches all over herself and her sister.\n\nIn the books, Bronn and Lollys get married successfully. In \"''A Feast for Crows''\", it is reported Lollys gave birth to a boy, strong and healthy,\u00a0and Bronn\u00a0named him\u00a0Tyrion.\u00a0Jaime\u00a0finds this amusing, but Cersei is displeased by the sellsword's insolence.\n\nQuite ironically, as a result of Cersei's\u00a0unsuccessful attempt\u00a0to dispose of Bronn, he becomes\u00a0Lord Stokeworth, and Lollys -\u00a0the Lady of Stokeworth.\n\nLollys's presence at the Riot of King's Landing, her rape in the riot, and her subsequent pregnancy, were all omitted from the TV series continuity. She is furthermore portrayed as being in better physical and mental condition, although she is implied to be a bit dim.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stokeworth navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stokeworth, Lollys}}\n\n[[de:Lollys Schurwerth]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u6d1b\u4e3d\u4e1d\u00b7\u53f2\u94ce\u514b\u6e25\u65af]]\n[[fr:Lollys Castelfoyer]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:House Stokeworth|Lollys Stokeworth]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

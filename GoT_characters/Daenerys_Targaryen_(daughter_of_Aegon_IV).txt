We took King Daeron II and his sister for our own, before they could take each other, and six kingdoms became seven. Even now, I do not blame my ancestors. One look at those long, silver locks. It is not every day a man gets to ride a dragon.|[[Oberyn Martell]]|House Martell (Histories & Lore)}}\nPrincess '''Daenerys Targaryen''' was a princess of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty and the namesake of the later [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|Queen]] [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys I]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nDaenerys was the daughter of [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]] and his sister-wife [[Naerys Targaryen]]. She was born in the year 182 AC.<ref name=\"bookprop\" /> The sister of King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]], she also had numerous bastard half-brothers: [[Daemon I Blackfyre]], [[Aegor Rivers]], [[Brynden Rivers]], and [[Shiera Seastar]] included.\n\nAt 17 years old, Daenerys married the Prince of [[Dorne]], [[Maron Martell|Maron]] of [[House Martell]] at [[Dragonstone]].<ref name=\"bookprop\" /> Their marriage helped solve the long question of Dornish independence by allowing for their unification into the realm. Through her brother King Daeron II, Daenerys was the aunt of Kings [[Aerys I Targaryen|Aerys I]] and [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]], and thus the great-aunt of both King [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon V the Unlikely]] and Aegon's brother, [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] of the [[Night's Watch]].\n\nDaenerys died in childbirth three years later, at the age of 20. The child was stillborn.<ref name=\"bookprop\" /> Maron and Daenerys had at least one child who survived beyond infancy, a crippled son who at one point was given a wheelchair as a present by Daenerys's brother Daeron II.<ref>\"[[The Last of the Starks]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nDaenerys, along with her family, is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.<ref name=\"bookprop\" />\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree Blackfyre Rebellion era}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Princess Daenerys was born well after her older brother, Daeron II, to the point that Daeron had already married and had a son, [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor Breakspear]]. Her betrothal to the Prince of Dorne, Maron Martell, was brokered by her brother Daeron as part of the treaty bringing Dorne under the authority of the [[Iron Throne]]. Daenerys supposedly loved her bastard half-brother, [[Daemon I Blackfyre]]. It was said the main reason Daemon rose in [[Blackfyre Rebellion|rebellion]] against Daeron was that Daenerys was denied to him. A year after the rebellion concluded, in 197 AC, the marriage between Daenerys and Maron was carried out and Dorne formally joined to the rest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].\n\nAfter Daemon's death, Prince Maron built his new bride the [[Water Gardens]], a place of beauty made of colored marble with pools and trees. Her children played in the pools along with the children of other highborn lords. One day when the sun was particularly hot, she took pity on the children of the servants and guards and allowed them to play in the pools with the highborn children, starting a tradition that is still practiced in Dorne to this day.\n\nWhile her brother's descendant Daenerys Stormborn is the third member of the Targaryen family to be named \"Daenerys\", Daenerys Stormborn is ''not'' called \"Daenerys III\", because \"Daenerys, daughter of Aegon IV\" and the first Daenerys (a daughter of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], according to ''Fire & Blood'') never ruled as queens. In fact, there has never been a ruling Targaryen queen before. When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty (after her [[Viserys Targaryen|brother]] dies), she is officially styled as \"Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of Her Name\". This has been confirmed to be the same in the TV series continuity, as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]] refers to her as \"Daenerys, First of Her Name\" in Season 2's episode \"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]\", and this is also how she is formally introduced throughout the following seasons.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Daenerys}}\n\n[[de:Daenerys Targaryen (Tochter von Aegon IV.)]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d (\u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u042d\u0439\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430 IV)]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

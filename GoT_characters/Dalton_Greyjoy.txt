By fourteen, Dalton had sailed as far as [[Old Ghis]], fought in a dozen battles, and claimed four [[salt wife|salt wives]]. In his 15th year, he avenged his uncle's death in battle, but he took a dozen wounds and emerged from the fight drenched head to heel in blood. From that day forth, men called him 'the Red Kraken'.|[[Euron Greyjoy]]|The Old Way}}\nLord '''Dalton Greyjoy''', also known as the '''Red Kraken''', was the [[Lord of the Iron Islands]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nDuring [[Aegon I Targaryen]]'s [[War of Conquest]], the great [[ironborn]] stronghold in the [[Riverlands]], [[Harrenhal]], was destroyed, and the Ironborn themselves were forced to retreat back to the Iron Islands. To maintain stability in his newly united kingdom, Aegon also forced the Ironborn to end their reaving and abandon the [[Old Way]]. Defeated in battle but not completely humbled, the Ironborn would tell each other tales of how they would eventually rise again, something that caught the attention of Dalton. He was rowing on a longship at the age of five, reaving at ten in the [[Basilisk Isles]] with his uncle, and by the age of fourteen, he had sailed as far as [[Old Ghis]], fought in a dozen battles, and claimed four [[Salt wife|salt wives]]. At the age of fifteen, he avenged his uncle's death in battle, taking a dozen wounds, and his entire body ended up covered in blood, earning him the nickname \"the Red Kraken\".<ref name=\"oldway\">\"[[The Old Way]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring the Dance of Dragons, Dalton and the ironborn sided with [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s [[Blacks]] since it allowed them to attack the [[Westerlands]] held by [[House Lannister]], whose troops were away fighting for [[Aegon II Targaryen]]'s [[Greens]]. The Ironborn were not able to take [[Casterly Rock]], since Lady [[Johanna Lannister]] was able to bar its gates, and they instead burned the Lannister fleet and sacked [[Lannisport]], taking gold, grain, and hundreds of women and girls captive, including Lord [[Jason Lannister]]'s favorite mistress and all his bastards.<ref name=\"oldway\" />\n\nBy all appearances, Dalton controlled the [[Sunset Sea]] and had returned the Ironborn to the Old Way. After the end of the war, however, the [[Iron Throne]] commanded that he stop his plundering, but Dalton refused. Shortly afterwards, one of his [[Tess|mistresses]] slit his throat while he was asleep (her motive is unknown), causing a succession dispute between his sons. The Lannisters used the opportunity to send troops to the Iron Islands, who killed thousands of men, women and children, and burned scores of villages and hundred of longships.<ref name=\"oldway\" />\n}}\n\n==In the books==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and \"''Fire & Blood''\", Dalton Greyjoy was a daring and bloodthirsty man, and also shrewd from a young age. He was loved by the men who served him, but not by women, as he tired of them quickly. During one of his raids, he claimed a [[Valyrian steel]] longsword from a dead corsair, naming it [[Nightfall]].\n\nAfter hearing of his father's death, Dalton returned to the [[Iron Islands]] to claim the [[Salt Throne|Seastone Chair]] and immediately began building longships, forging swords and training warriors, claiming \"the storm is coming\". By the time Dalton had turned sixteen, King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] died, and Dalton was said to have laughed upon hearing of the outbreak of the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]]'s supporters (the [[Greens]]) offered him the position of [[Master of Ships]] and the admiralty to replace [[Tyland Lannister]], who had become [[Master of Coin]], in exchange for bringing his ships around [[Westeros]] to battle [[Corlys Velaryon]]'s fleet.\n\nDalton instead chose to wait for [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and her supporters (the [[Blacks]]) to make an offer, and on the [[Black Council]], Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] suggested that they appeal to Dalton's bloodlust to bring him to their side. Rhaenyra did not ask him to sail for [[Blackwater Bay]], only that he attack her enemies. Dalton chose to side with the Blacks, given that the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] fighting for the Greens were not able to protect the [[Westerlands]] near the Iron Islands. After sacking [[Lannisport]], he captured Kayce and [[Fair Isle]], where he claimed four of Lord Farman's daughters as [[salt wives]]. He gave the fifth, the \"homely one\", to his brother Veron.\n\nAfter Dalton's death and the attack on the Iron Islands, one of his sons was taken captive and sent to [[Casterly Rock]], where Lady Johanna had him gelded and made a court fool for her son.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greyjoy, Dalton}}\n\n[[de:Dalten Graufreud]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0436\u043e\u0439]]\n[[Category:Lords Reaper of Pyke]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Iron Islands]]\n[[Category:Members of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Blacks]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

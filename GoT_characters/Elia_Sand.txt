Her mother is Oberyn's [[paramour]], [[Ellaria Sand]]. She was named after her aunt, the late Princess [[Elia Martell]].<ref name=\"E35\">\"[[First of His Name]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nOberyn writes a poem to Elia and mentions her willful behavior to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. He explains that he named her after his murdered sister, but this ended up making him sad when he talks to her, which in turn leads to him being angry around her. Cersei, in a rare moment of genuine motherly insight, suggests that this may be the cause of her behavior.<ref name=\"E35\" />\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Martell family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Elia Sand is fourteen years old. She is described as wearing her black hair in a braid and having her father's eyes. She\u00a0is very impetuous and reckless,\u00a0fond of horses and jousting, for which she often smells like a horse to her mother's despair. Her weapon of choice is the lance, for which she's dubbed \"Lady Lance\". Her mother affectionately refers to her as \"El\". Although she is the first of the younger Sand Snakes, she is just old enough to spend time with her older half-sisters and share their rapport with their cousin, Arianne Martell.\n\nAfter [[Doran Martell]] hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he arrests them lest they ignite a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Ellaria and her daughters, including Elia, are placed under house arrest in the [[Water Gardens]], lest they be used in plots against Doran or the Lannisters. Following the arrival of Ser [[Balon Swann]], Doran reveals his true colors to the elder Sand Snakes and releases Elia, her mother and sisters.\n\nCurrently, according to Arianne's sample chapters from the unpublished sixth novel, Elia accompanies her on a mission to meet the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia, and [[Jon Connington]].\n\nWhen the group reaches [[Ghost Hill]], Elia\u00a0is so dirty, covered by\u00a0chalk and dust from heels to hair, that\u00a0Lady Valena Toland mistakes her for\u00a0a stable girl.\u00a0Later, during the sea voyage, Elia flirts with and challenges Ser Joss Hood and Ser Garibald Shells, till Arianne tells her sharply \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady\" and sends her below deck to end the conversation.\n\nWhile travelling through the [[Rainwood]], Elia explores a cave, in which there are cave carvings of faces (presumably of the [[Children of the Forest]]). She finds inside a still black pool and catches fish, oblivious that her companions may be\u00a0worried about her. Arianne and the others eventually find her.\u00a0Arianne chides Elia for her irresponsible behavior and threatens to send her back if she does not obey; Elia reluctantly swears on her father's bones that she will.\n\nDespite her oath, Elia continues to misbehave: at Mistfall, Arianne catches her\u00a0flirting with a servant named Feathers. Arianne chides Elia for her improper behavior, pointing out that Feathers is twice her age and a servant. Elia flippantly answers that they were just kissing.\u00a0\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\u00a0\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sand, Elia}}\n[[es:Elia Arena]]\n[[pl:Elia Sand]]\n[[zh:\u4f0a\u8389\u4e9a\u00b7\u6c99\u5fb7]]\n[[pt-br:Elia Sand]]\n[[de:Elia Sand]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0421\u044d\u043d\u0434]]\n[[fr:Elia Sand]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

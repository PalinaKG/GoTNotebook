While the Tickler asks questions, Weasel straps the victim, and then places a wooden bucket with a rat inside over the victim's bare chest. At the Tickler's command, Weasel begins to heat the bucket with a torch to make the rat claw its way out through the victim's chest.<ref>\"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|4=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Weese is the understeward of the Wailing Tower in Harrenhal and a servant of [[House Whent]] that later submits to [[House Lannister]]. He is a cruel and abusive man, resorting to violence at the slightest provocation, even just for staring at him. He treats [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and other servants very brutally. He, not [[Amory Lorch]], is the second man whom Arya tells [[Jaqen H'ghar]] to kill, because he was mean to her.\n\n\"Weasel\" is a different character, a little girl about two years old whose real name is unknown. She and a woman whose right hand was cut off, perhaps her mother, were found by [[Yoren]] on the march north from [[King's Landing]]. The one-armed woman died shortly afterwards, leaving the girl in the custody of the caravan. When [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] and his men caught Arya, [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], [[Hot Pie]], and [[Lommy]], Weasel managed to escape, and has not been seen since then. Arya takes her name as an alias while at the castle. For the TV series, the young girl Weasel has been removed and the name given to Weese.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Weese}} \n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Clegane navbox}}\n\n[[ru:\u0425\u043e\u0440\u0451\u043a]]\n[[zh:\u201c\u9ec4\u9f20\u72fc\u201d]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Clegane]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

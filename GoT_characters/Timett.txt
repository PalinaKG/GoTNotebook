He is a large and fierce young man with only one eye. Despite his youth, his savagery and success in battle have seen him rise high amongst the hill tribes.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is captured by [[Shagga]] and the [[Stone Crows]] while traversing the Vale. Tyrion offers an alliance to the Hill Tribes; fight the enemies of [[House Lannister]] in exchange for weapons, gold and autonomy from the [[Eyrie]]. Timett agrees to the alliance and escorts Tyrion to the Lannister encampment in the [[Riverlands]]. They are joined by other clans including [[Chella]] and the [[Black Ears]], the [[Moon Brothers]] and the [[Painted Dogs]]. Timett is presented to [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] by Tyrion. Tywin accepts the alliance and Shagga's insistence that they fight alongside Tyrion on the battlefield.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\nThe Burned Men take part in the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. They then engage in post-battle looting.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nTimett and his men escort Tyrion to [[King's Landing]] where he becomes Acting [[Hand of the King]] on behalf of Tywin.<ref>\"[[The North Remembers]]\"</ref>\n\nAfter Tyrion discovers that [[Pycelle]] is spying on him for [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], Timett and [[Bronn]] accompany him to confront Pycelle. Tyrion orders Timett to cut off Pycelle's manhood and feed it to the goats. Timett points out that there are no goats nearby and Tyrion is exasperated. Tyrion settles for shortening his beard and confining him to the Black Cells.<ref>\"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=note|9=note}}\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|note||yes}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Uncredited appearances\n\n==Quotes==\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Tyrion Lannister|Cut off his manhood, and feed it to the goats.|Timett|There are no goats, halfman!|Well, ''make do''!|[[Tyrion Lannister]] threatens [[Pycelle]] with orders to Timett.|What Is Dead May Never Die}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Burned Men are noted as the most unpredictable and savage of the mountain clans, and Timett is the most feared of them. Normally Burned Men are expected to burn off a finger or nipple as a show of might during their rite of manhood, but Timett burned out an eye as a sign of bravery and might, which earned him great respect within his tribe and the title of Red Hand.\n\nTimett and more of the Burned Men are among the clansmen who follow Tyrion to the Lannister camp, and subsequently participate the [[Battle of the Green Fork]].\n\nIn \"''A Clash of Kings''\", when Tyrion is sent to King's Landing to act as the Hand of the King, Timett is among the clansmen who escort and serve him as bodyguards and enforcers.\n\n[[Varys]] and Bronn report Tyrion that Timett killed a wineseller's son at a gambling den; the fool thought that a one-eyed man would be easier to cheat, but Timett caught him, pinned his wrist to the table with a dagger and ripped out his throat barehanded. Hearing that, Tyrion nonchalantly comments that the honest men of the city owe Timett a debt of gratitude.\n\nIn \"''A Storm of Swords''\", Bronn informs Tyrion that Timett led the Burned Men back to the Vale, with all the plunder they took from Stannis's camp after the fighting.\n\nTimett does not appear in the next novels. He is only listed among the chief clans in the appendices of \"''A Feast for Crows''\" and \"''A Dance with Dragons''\".\n\nIn \"''A Dance with Dragons''\", when Tyrion, [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] and their dwarf companion Penny arrive at the [[Second Sons]]' camp, Tyrion assures Ben Plumm that he can be very generous to his friends; he jokingly mentions Timett (alongside Shagga and Bronn) as a referee.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[de:Timett]]\n[[es:Timett]]\n[[fr:Timett]]\n[[it:Timett]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u63d0\u9b45]]\n[[Category:Hill tribes]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

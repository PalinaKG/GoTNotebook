It is unknown which [[noble House]] he hailed from.\n\n===\u200b[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nDuring the\u00a0[[Battle of Castle Black]], Donnel takes part in defending the [[Wall]] against [[Mance Rayder]]'s forces. He helps load the barrels onto the ramps. When\u00a0[[Castle Black]]'s inner gate is threatened by the [[Giants|giant]] [[Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg]], he accompanies [[Grenn]], [[Cooper]], and three other black brothers to defend it. Although he initially wavers and considers fleeing upon seeing the giant, he is convinced by Grenn to stay and fulfill his oath to the Night's Watch. They successfully kill the giant, but all of the black brothers are slain in the process. Their bodies are discovered by [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] after the battle.<ref>\"[[The Watchers on the Wall]]\"</ref>\n\nAfter the arrival of\u00a0[[Stannis Baratheon]] and his forces, though not seen Donnel is among the numerous bodies of fallen black brothers burned in Castle Black's courtyard.<ref>\"[[The Children]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 4 appearances|||||||||yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Donnel Hill, nicknamed \"Sweet Donnel Hill\", is a steward of the Night's Watch and the squire of Ser Mallador Locke. He claims to be a bastard of [[House Lannister]], and many fans speculate that he is a son of [[Tywin Lannister]] for his similarities to other Lannisters of Tywin's line (yellow hair worn down in a tumble, fat lips, and a sarcastic japing personality).\n\nWhile the [[Great Ranging|ranging]] force camps at the [[Fist of the First Men]], Donnel is among the fourteen brothers (alongside Chett, Lark, Dirk, Ollo Lophand, Paul and [[Karl Tanner#In the books|Clubfoot Karl]]) who plot to murder [[Jeor Mormont]], [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] and other prominent brothers and to desert. The sudden snowfall and the subsequent [[Battle of the Fist of the First Men|attack of the Others]] foils their plan. However, during the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep]] Donnel sides with those who are loyal to Mormont; it is unknown what made him change his mind. He and the other Loyalists make it to Castle Black long before [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and Sam.\n\nDonnel survives the Battle of Castle Black. He is not one of the brothers who go with the blacksmith Donal Noye to protect the gate, thus he is not killed by the giant Mag.\n\nDonnel is one of the four brothers who, at Jon's command, shoot arrows at Mance Rayder (actually, it is the [[Lord of Bones]] in disguise) while he is executed by burning, in order to grant him a quick and painless death.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n[[ru:\u0414\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043b \u0425\u0438\u043b\u043b]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hill, Donnel}}\n[[Category:Stewards of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Casualties of the conflict beyond the Wall]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

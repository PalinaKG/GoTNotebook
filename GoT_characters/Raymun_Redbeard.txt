He waited for our patrols to pass and sent climbers to the now unguarded stretch of the Wall. When they reached the top, they dropped ropes and ladders for thousands more wildlings to clamber up. The Night's Watch didn't even know his army had crossed until after the Starks and Umbers had cornered and destroyed him, and that was a hundred years ago, when the Watch had many more men than now.|[[Samwell Tarly]]|The Wall}}\n'''Raymun Redbeard''' was a [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] of the [[Free Folk]], living roughly a hundred years ago.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Raymun Redbeard and army climb the Wall.png|thumb|Raymun Redbeard's wildling army climbed over the Wall to bypass the dwindling Night's Watch garrisons.]]\nRaymun Redbeard assumed the title of King-Beyond-the-Wall and led an invasion of the [[North]]. He figured that the Wall's massive size was both its greatest advantage and its greatest flaw, making it impossible to patrol the entire fortification day and night. So when the patrols passed, he sent his climbers to scale the Wall and leave ropes and ladders for his army to follow after.\n\nThe Night's Watch did not even know of his passing until his force was [[Battle at Long Lake|already cornered and destroyed]] by the combined efforts of [[House Stark]] and [[House Umber]].<ref>\"[[The Wall]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\n\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Raymun Redbeard was [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] in the time of Lord William Stark, the grandfather of Lord [[Rickard Stark]]. Having seen the decline of the Night's Watch under the leadership of Lord Commander Jack Musgood, Raymun and his raiders crossed over the [[Wall]] and invaded the North. Eventually, the invading force engaged in battle against the Northerners led by William Stark and Lord Harmond of [[House Umber]], \"the Drunken Giant\". Lord William was slain and his younger brother, Artos Stark, \"the Implacable\", slew Raymun. Raymun's younger brother fled back [[beyond the Wall]] and became known as \"the Red Raven\", for having fled from battle, \"Red\" for the color of his hair and \"Raven\" because it rhymed with \"craven\".\n\nThe Night's Watch arrived too late to fight so Artos, grieving over the headless corpse of his brother, assigned them the shameful task of burying the dead. Lord Commander Musgood was forever after known as \"Sleepy Jack\".\n\nThe wildling raider Gerrick Kingsblood boasts direct descent from Raymun Redbeard but is actually descended from the Red Raven, a fact most Free Folk are aware of and use to disparage him.\n\nThe ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' prequel novellas begin in 209 AC, and while the three currently published ones only extend to the year 211 AC, future installments are intended to stretch forward to over the next fifty years of history, using time jumps. Raymund Redbeard led his attack over the Wall in 226 AC, meaning that he is the current King-Beyond-The-Wall during the ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' era, and that he might appear in any potential live-action adaptation of the prequels.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{KingsBeyondTheWall}}\n\n[[de:Raymun Rotbart]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0443\u043d \u0420\u044b\u0436\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044b\u0439]]\n[[Category:Free Folk]]\n[[Category:Kings-Beyond-the-Wall]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

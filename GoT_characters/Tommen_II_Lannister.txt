He led an expedition to the [[Valyrian Peninsula]] from which he never returned. He carried with him the [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Brightroar]], which was lost with him.<ref>\"[[Valyrian Steel (Histories & Lore)|Valyrian Steel]]\"</ref>\n\n== In the books ==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, King Tommen II is briefly mentioned. In ''The World of Ice and Fire'' his story is briefly expanded. The last report of him is a\u00a0[[Volantis|Volantene]] chronicle titled\u00a0''The Glory of Volantis''\u00a0which mentions a \"golden fleet\" bearing the \"Lion King\" stayed at Volantis for supplies, and that the\u00a0[[triarch]]s\u00a0showered him with gifts. According to the chronicle, Tommen II swore that half of all he would find would be given to the triarchs in return for their generosity and the promise to send their fleet to his aid when he requested it. Afterward he sailed away. The next year, the chronicle states that Triarch\u00a0Marqelo Tagaros\u00a0dispatched a squadron toward Valyria to find any sign of Tommen's golden fleet, but returned empty handed.\n\nTommen II apparently lived a few years or few decades after the Doom of Valyria, which was itself a century before the [[War of Conquest|Targaryen Conquest]] of [[Westeros]]. It is said that the Lannisters acquired Brightroar in the century before the Doom, and that Tommen II disappeared a little over a century after that.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Tommen II}}\n\n[[fr:Tommen II Lannister]]\n[[it:Tommen II Lannister]]\n[[de:Tommen II.

[[The Father]] pulled down seven stars from the heavens and set them upon the brow of Hugor to make a glowing crown. [[The Maiden]] then brought him a girl as supple as willow, with eyes like deep pools, whom Hugor declared he would take as his bride. [[The Mother]] made her fertile, and [[the Crone]] foretold that she would give him forty-four mighty sons. [[The Warrior]] gave strength to their arms, and [[the Smith]] made a suit of iron plates for both of them.<ref>\"[[The Seven-Pointed Star (Histories & Lore)|The Seven-Pointed Star]]\"</ref> The gods crowned him as King of the Andals, and promised him that his people would one day rule great kingdoms in a foreign continent.<ref>\"[[The Faith Militant]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Hugor's story is the same. It is unclear exactly when he is supposed to have lived, though apparently it was some time before the [[Andal Invasion]] began (the histories don't mention him in [[Westeros]] itself). Due to his legendary status it is unknown if a single king named \"Hugor\" ever truly existed (much less if he actually met gods), just as among the [[First Men]] it is unclear if figures such as [[Durran]] Godsgrief ever truly lived and warred against gods of the sea and sky.\n\nWhile [[Tyrion Lannister]] is traveling away from Westeros, one of the assumed names he uses is Hugor Hill - \"Hill\" being the bastard surname used in the Westerlands. Tyrion uses this name when he is traveling east from [[Pentos]] through [[Andalos]] - thinking to himself on how the legendary Hugor allegedly lived there, and pondering how his own [[Andals|Andal]] ancestors once walked the same lands he is now crossing through.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[fr:Hugor de la Colline]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0440 \u0441 \u0425\u043e\u043b\u043c\u0430]]\n[[Category:History]]\n[[Category:Legendary figures]]\n[[Category:Kings of the Andals]]\n[[Category:Faith of the Seven]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Essosi]]\n[[Category:Andals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

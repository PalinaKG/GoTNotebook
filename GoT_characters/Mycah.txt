Despite his protests that the weapon he was using was only a stick, Joffrey sadistically and slowly slashes\u00a0his cheek with his sword, prompting\u00a0Arya to attack him, throwing his sword into the stream. Mycah\u00a0manages to escape, but later is killed by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] at Joffrey's orders, much to [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]'s disdain.

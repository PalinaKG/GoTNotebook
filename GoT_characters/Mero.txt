He hails from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Braavos]]. His nickname, \"the Titan's Bastard\", makes reference to the [[Titan of Braavos]], the enormous statue that guards the harbor entrance to the city.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nAlong with his co-captain [[Prendahl na Ghezn]] and a lieutenant, [[Daario Naharis]], he meets [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in her tent outside Yunkai but snubs her offer to fight for her on the premise that the Second Sons already had a contract with [[Yunkai]]. After aiming several lewd comments at Daenerys, which offend Daenerys's bodyguards so much that [[Grey Worm]] offers to cut Mero's tongue out, and groping [[Missandei]], he leads the Second Sons out of her tent with a barrel of wine as a token of her willingness to work with them. Despite putting up with his insults while in his presence, the moment he is gone Daenerys orders [[Barristan Selmy]] to kill Mero first if their armies come to battle, to which Barristan replies he will be glad to do so. \n\nMero is next seen back at his camp discussing Daenerys with Daario and Prendahl while groping a [[Yunkai'i whore|Yunkish bedslave]] on his lap. They eventually decide to assassinate her. Mero gives the Yunkish slave three coins to hand out at random to the three Second Sons to decide which of them should do the deed \u2013 Daario winds up with the Braavosi coin, leaving the task to him. Later that night, Daario enters Daenerys's tent and produces Mero's head, along with that of Prendahl, and pledges the Second Sons to her cause.<ref>\"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances||||||||yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"160\">\nsecond sons Mero.jpg|Mero in \"Second Sons\"\nMeroSecondSons.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mero's background is the same. He is described as having pale green eyes and a bushy red beard. He is the captain of the Second Sons, though under his leadership the Second Sons' reputation has fallen to the point where none of the [[Free Cities]] will hire him any longer.\n\nIn the books, as the Second Sons are a separate company from the Stormcrows \u2013 to which Daario Naharis and Prendahl na Ghezn belong \u2013 Mero is not killed by Daario, instead he flees when the Stormcrows go over to Daenerys and attack the Yunkish forces.\n\nLater, after disguising himself among the freedmen by shaving off his hair and beard, Mero attempts to kill Daenerys, but is stopped by Barristan Selmy (still disguised as \"Arstan Whitebeard\"). Selmy fights Mero off with a staff, breaking his jaw and right leg; Mero collapses, then he is promptly set upon and killed by an enraged mob of freedmen.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n*{{AWOIAF|Sallor the Bald}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[de:Mero]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0435\u0440\u043e]]\n[[fr:Mero]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Second Sons]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Braavosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

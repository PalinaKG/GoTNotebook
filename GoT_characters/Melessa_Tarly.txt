She is a first cousin of [[Selyse Baratheon]] (the wife of [[Stannis Baratheon]]), Lord [[Axell Florent]], and [[Imry Florent]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nWhen [[Jon Snow]] asks Samwell what he is doing at the [[Wall]], Samwell tells him that his father did not think him manly enough to inherit his title and lands so he forced him to join the Night's Watch or he implied that he would kill him and tell Melessa that it was a hunting accident.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nBefore leaving [[Craster's Keep]], Samwell gives [[Gilly]] a thimble that once belonged to Lady Melessa.

She is also delighted when she sees little Sam, and coos over her \"grandchild\". At dinner that evening, Melessa notices that Gilly seems unused to cutlery and seems to be copying her when trying to eat. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly, and finally stands up for him, offering the opinion that being the [[Order of Maesters|maester]] to the Night's Watch is an honor. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a [[Free Folk|wildling]], Melessa listens to his rant before finally snapping and giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow.<ref name=\"Blood of My Blood\">\"[[Blood of My Blood]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen Sam takes Gilly and the baby and escapes in the middle of the night, he tells Gilly that his mother will understand.<ref name=\"Blood of My Blood\" />\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances|6 = yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Florent family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Melessa Florent is a daughter of Lord Alester Florent, head of House Florent and Lord of [[Brightwater Keep]], and Lady Melara Crane.

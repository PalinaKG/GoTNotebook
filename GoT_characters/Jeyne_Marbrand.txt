She was married to [[Tytos Lannister]] in 235 AC, in a double ceremony with Tytos's older brother [[Tion Lannister]], who married [[Ellyn Reyne]].\n\nTion died the following year leaving Ellyn Reyne a widow. Ellyn tried to seduce Tytos, but he did not go through with the act; instead Tytos went to Jeyne and confessed it all. Jeyne forgave her husband, but not Ellyn. Jeyne went to her father-in-law, Lord Gerold Lannister, who married Ellyn off to [[Walderan Tarbeck]], thereby removing her from [[Casterly Rock]].\n\nJeyne remained and gave birth to five children in total. In 242 AC, she birthed Tytos a son [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]. Two years later she gave birth to [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], and the year after that a daughter Genna. Jeyne also had another son, Tygett.\n\nGiving birth in 255 AC for the fifth time, Jeyne delivered a healthy son Gerion, but she died within a moon's turn. Tytos had always been known as the Laughing Lion, but his grief over Jeyne's death affected him deeply, and Tytos was never referred to by that title again in his life.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marbrand, Jeyne}}\n[[fr:Jeyne Marpheux]]\n[[de:Jeyne Marbrand]]\n[[es:Jeyne Marbrand]]\n[[it:Jeyne Marbrand]]\n[[nl:Jeane Marbrand]]\n[[zh:\u7b80\u59ae\u00b7\u9a6c\u5c14\u5e03\u5170]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043d \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Marbrand]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

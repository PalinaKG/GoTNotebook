[[House Greyjoy]] of [[Pyke]] claims descent from him.<ref>\"[[The Age of Heroes]]\"</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBlessed by the [[Drowned God]], the Grey King was said to have waged war against the [[Storm God]] himself for a thousand years and slain [[Nagga]], the first sea dragon, using its bones to build his hall.

Unable to overpower one another, they held the first [[Kingsmoot]] to elect the strongest as their king.<ref name=\"Kingsmoot\"/>\n\n==In the books==\nThe ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels give more detail about the Grey King's life. He reigned for a thousand years with a mermaid as his wife and plotted his war against the Storm God. He supposedly wore robes of woven seaweed and a tall pale crown made from Nagga's teeth. From Nagga's bones he made his hall, the Grey King's Hall, which he heated with Nagga's living fire. When the Grey King died, the Storm God snuffed out the fire and the sea stole his throne. Only his hall remains.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n{{LegendaryHeroes}}\n\n[[de:Grauer K\u00f6nig]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c]]\n[[Category:Legendary figures]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Kings of the Iron Islands]]\n[[Category:Members of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

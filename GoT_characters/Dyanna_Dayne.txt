When [[Aegon V Targaryen|Egg]] offers to [[squire]] for [[Duncan the Tall|Dunk]] at the [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Ashford]], Dunk asks what his mother would say of it. Egg replies that she would not have anything to say, because she is dead. Her name is revealed in the companion book ''The World of Ice and Fire''.\n\nIt isn't clear exactly when Dyanna died. Egg was around 10 years old at the time of the Tourney at Ashford in 209 AC, when he said his mother was dead. Egg also had one younger sibling, his sister Rhae, so Dyanna must have been alive until at least 201 AC - probably closer to 201 AC than 209 AC, given that Dyanna was old enough to interact with other characters by around 209-210 AC. Whatever the case, Maekar did not become king until many years after Dyanna died, so she was never a Queen Consort (indeed, in 209 AC Maekar's own father was still alive and king, and Maekar's elder brother Aerys I ruled after him, before Maekar succeeded to the throne).\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Dayne navbox}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n\n[[fr:Dyanna Dayne]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dayne, Dyanna}}\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Dayne]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Despite being a foreigner from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]], he is well-regarded for the quality of his work and has received the patronage of many knights and even some lords. Mott is assisted by his apprentice smith, a young man named [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[Eddard Stark]] learns from [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] that his predecessor [[Jon Arryn]] visited Mott several times prior to his death. Eddard goes to question Mott and learns that Arryn displayed a particular interest in Gendry.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n\nGendry tells [[Arya Stark|Arya]] that he is an armorer's apprentice, but his master got sick of him, so he ended up at [[Yoren]]'s caravan; apparently, Gendry is unaware that he was made to leave for the [[Wall]] to avoid the upcoming [[massacre in King's Landing|purge of Robert's other bastard children]].<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nMott is forcibly questioned by the [[gold cloaks]] about the whereabouts of Gendry. He reluctantly tells [[Janos Slynt]] that Gendry joined the [[Night's Watch]] and that he can be recognized by the bull-shaped helm he sports.<ref>\"[[The North Remembers]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nWhen Gendry mentions to the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] that he apprenticed under Tobho, [[Thoros]] notes that Tobho charges double what the other smiths do. Gendry retorts this by saying it is because his work is twice the quality.<ref>\"[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]\"</ref> Later, Gendry says he is done serving men, because Tobho sold him to the Night's Watch.<ref>\"[[Kissed by Fire]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|4=yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nGendry 1x04.png|Gendry working in Tobho Mott's blacksmith forge.\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tobho Mott is a native of the [[Free City]] of [[Qohor]] who learned to smith there, including the working of the fabled [[Valyrian steel]]. He moved to [[Westeros]] when younger and has successfully built up his own business thanks to his formidable skills. His armory is a large building at the top of the Street of Steel, impressive in size and outfitting.\n\nTobho used to scold Thoros about the latter's habit of dousing his blades in [[wildfire]], which subsequently wrecked the steel.\n\nIt is not Littlefinger but a potboy, who belonged to Arryn's household, who tells Eddard that Arryn and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] visited Mott. Mott tells Ned that they indeed visited his armory, and asked to see Gendry.\n\nWhen Eddard asks Mott who paid him Gendry's apprentice fee, Mott answers evasively, but eventually admits it was [[Varys|a mysterious lord]] who did not identify himself that paid him both the apprentice fee and to keep his mouth shut about the youth.\n\nIn the books, Mott is not interrogated about Gendry's whereabouts. It is not explained how the Gold Cloaks knew that Gendry was with [[Yoren]]'s caravan.\n\nMott, not [[Valyrian sword smith|an unnamed smith from Volantis]], is the one who melts [[Ice]] to forge two [[Widow's Wail|new]] [[Oathkeeper|swords]] at [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s order.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Mott, Tobho}}\n\n[[de:Tobho Mott]]\n[[pl:Tobho Mott]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0442\u0442]]\n[[fr:Tobho Mott]]\n[[zh:\u6258\u5e03\u00b7\u83ab\u7279]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Blacksmiths]]\n[[Category:Qohorik]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

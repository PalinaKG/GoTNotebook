The [[Riverlands]] are one of the constituent regions of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and [[House Tully]] is one of the [[Great House]]s of the realm. House Tully rules the region from their seat at [[Riverrun]] and Hoster also holds the title [[Lord of Riverrun]].<ref name=\"Hoster Tully viewers guide\">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-3/episode-4/people/46/hoster-tully/ HBO viewers guide, season 3: episode 4 people, Hoster Tully entry]</ref>\n\nHoster married Lady [[Minisa Tully|Minisa]] of [[House Whent]].

Hoster joined House Stark, [[House Baratheon]] and [[House Arryn]] in opposing the Mad King. Catelyn married Brandon's brother [[Eddard Stark]] and Hoster arranged for Lysa to marry Lord [[Jon Arryn]] to solidify the alliance. They won the war and installed [[Robert Baratheon]] as the [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]]. The army of Lord [[Walder Frey]], Hoster's bannerman, arrived after the [[Battle of the Trident]] had already been won by the rebels, causing Hoster to nickname him \"the Late Lord Frey\" to Lord Walder's great irritation.<ref name=\"E30\">\"[[Mhysa]]\"</ref><ref>\"[[House Frey (Histories & Lore)]]\"</ref>\n\nIn recent years Hoster had become old and frail, losing a great deal of weight.<ref name=\"Hoster Tully viewers guide\" /> By the beginning of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Hoster had been bedridden for a considerable amount of time from a prolonged illness, and only semi-coherent.

Hoster's brother Brynden, son Edmure, daughter Catelyn, and grandson [[Robb Stark]] are present for his funeral at Riverrun. As per Tully funeral tradition, his body is set adrift on the Red Fork of the [[Trident]] River in a funeral boat, and then set on fire by a flaming arrow - so that his ashes will return to the river which sustains their lands. Brynden tells Catelyn that he and Hoster managed to make peace before his death. Hoster told Brynden to stop calling himself \"The Blackfish\" as it is an old joke and it wasn't very funny to begin with.

Weiss]] reveal that Hoster is played by the show's line producer [[Christopher Newman]].\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Hoster is an old, spent man close to the end of his life. In his prime he was a canny politician and effective military commander, and was a vital supporter of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s uprising against the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty. He was married to Lady Minisa Whent, of the great castle of Harrenhal, who passed away some years before the events of the series begin.\n\nIn ''A Game of Thrones'', Catelyn visits her father after [[Robb Stark]] breaks the siege in the [[Battle of the Camps]]. At that point, Hoster is still lucid. In the next books, his health deteriorates rapidly. Most of the time he loses contact with reality, does not recognize his children, and mumbles incoherently.\n\nAt one of those occasions, Catelyn hears her father mumbles: \"Tansy... forgive me... the blood... oh, please... Tansy... dead. You'll have others... Sweet babes, and trueborn. Be a good wife and the gods will bless you... sons... trueborn sons\". At first Catelyn thinks that her father might have wronged some village maiden named Tansy, but after thinking it over, recalling Lysa's tearful reaction when Catelyn let her hold baby [[Robb Stark|Robb]], she realizes the terrible secret that haunts her father on his deathbed: Lysa got pregnant some time before her marriage to Jon Arryn, and their father forced her to undergo an abortion by drinking Moon tea (one of its ingredients is the herb called Tansy). Near his death, Hoster feels deep regret for what he did to his daughter. Catelyn writes to her sister about it, telling her that their father's thoughts are all of the wrong he did Lysa, and that he needs her forgiveness, begging her at least to write him a few words of love so he may die in peace. Catelyn feels the letter is too little and too late for her father is likely to die before Lysa answers, but sends it anyway. Lysa does not respond.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Tully navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tully, Hoster}}\n\n[[de:Hoster Tully]]\n[[es:Hoster Tully]]\n[[pl:Hoster Tully]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0422\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438]]\n[[fr:Hoster Tully]]\n[[zh:\u970d\u65af\u7279\u00b7\u5f92\u5229]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Lords of Riverrun|Hoster]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tully]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

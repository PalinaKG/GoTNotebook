Exactly how it sounds: seven men against seven men. Makes for a good show, but any man who has been in battle knows that the more men involved, the less skill needed, the more chance of accidents. Just ask that Targaryen prince who got his head staved in by his brother all those years ago, and all for some hedge knight.|[[Bronn]]|Justice of the Seven Kingdoms}}\n'''Baelor Targaryen''' was the firstborn son and heir of King [[Daeron II Targaryen]], and served as his [[Hand of the King|Hand]] during the latter years of his reign.\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nPrince Baelor was the eldest son of King [[Daeron II Targaryen]] and Queen [[Myriah Martell]]. He was the brother of [[Aerys I Targaryen|Aerys]], [[Rhaegel Targaryen|Rhaegel]], [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]] and [[Aelinor Targaryen|Aelinor]].\n\nHe was killed when his brother Maekar staved his head in during the [[trial by seven of Duncan the Tall]].<ref>\"[[Justice of the Seven Kingdoms]]\"</ref> Had he survived and ascended the throne, he would have ruled as \"Baelor II\".\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nPrince Baelor, along with his family, is mentioned in [[House Targaryen]]'s entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nBaelor is mentioned under Ser Duncan the Tall's entry, in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', which the new [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] flicks through. The book states Prince [[Aerion Targaryen]] had a hand in his death.<ref>\"[[The Iron Throne]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree Blackfyre Rebellion era}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Hammer and the Anvil.png|Baelor battles his brother [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]] in the [[trial by seven of Duncan the Tall]].\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Prince Baelor was the eldest son of King Daeron the Good and Queen Myriah, and named after Baelor I. He had the dark hair of his mother, Queen Myriah, which he kept cut short and kept his jaw clean-shaven. His nose had been broken twice. He was known as \"Baelor Breakspear\" and was the father of Princes Valarr and Matarys Targaryen.\n\nWhen the Blackfyre Rebellion was in its early stages, Prince Baelor advocated leniency toward his bastard uncle [[Daemon I Blackfyre]], a position that was rejected in favor of his other bastard uncle [[Brynden Rivers]]'s more hard line approach. Nonetheless, Baelor accepted the path towards war and distinguished himself by leading the Dornish-Stormlands force that attacked the rearguard of the rebel army during the [[Battle of the Redgrass Field]], smashing them against the shield-wall of his brother, Prince Maekar, and inspiring the song ''The Hammer and Anvil''. After the battle, he was named [[Hand of the King]] by his father. At some point he was also given the title of [[Protector of the Realm]].\n\nWhile participating in a rare [[trial by seven]], Baelor's youngest brother Maekar accidentally dealt him a severe blow to the head with his mace. Baelor had entered the trial wearing his son's lighter armor, which did not fit properly and didn't provide adequate protection. Maekar had not meant to harm Baelor, and Baelor seemed fine at first, acknowledging that it was an accident. Soon, however, Baelor started behaving drunkenly, and he actually had a severe concussion from which he died in a matter of hours. The guilt of accidentally killing his own brother haunted Maekar for the rest of his days.\n\nWhen he died, his son Valarr became heir-apparent to the Iron Throne, but he and his younger brother Matarys both died during the [[Great Spring Sickness]] only hours before Daeron II. This lead to Daeron II being succeeded by his second son, Aerys I.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Baelor}}\n[[es:Baelor Targaryen]]\n[[pl:Baelor Targaryen (syn Daerona II)]]\n[[pt-br:Baelor Targaryen (filho de Daeron II)]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0435\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0440 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d (\u0441\u044b\u043d \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 II)]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

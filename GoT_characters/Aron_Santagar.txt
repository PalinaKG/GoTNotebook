When [[Sansa Stark]] appears to ask for mercy for her [[Eddard Stark|father]], she greets Ser Aron, though the knight turns away.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\nSer Aron dies during the riots in King's Landing.<ref>\"[[The Old Gods and the New]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Aron Santagar is the Master-at-Arms of the Red Keep. He is Dornish, as revealed in the fourth novel, and is described by Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] as a vain but honest man.\n\nIn the first book, Ser Aron is secretly approached by Ser Rodrik to see if he might recognize the dagger used by the [[Catspaw assassin|assassin]] sent to murder [[Bran Stark]]. He also participates in the Tourney of the Hand.\n\nUpon their arrival in King's Landing, Tyrion sends Podrick to Ser Aron for training. Pod's training comes to an end when Ser Aron is killed.\n\nDuring the [[Riot of King's Landing]], Tyrion sees Ser Aron being pulled from his saddle, the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp. His body is later found in a gutter, his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm. According to [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], four men held Ser Aron down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone; the Hound intervened and gutted one, but his action did not save Ser Aron's life. \n\nIn the parallel episode scene of the riot, several courtiers are shown to be attacked by the rioting mob; it is unclear if any of these were meant to be Ser Aron.\n\nWhile Ser Aron died in the second novel, as of the fifth novel no specific replacement for him as Master-of-Arms at the Red Keep has been mentioned.\n\nTommen, who has befriended Loras Tyrell, tells his mother he wishes Loras to be the new Master-of-Arms. Jaime thinks too that Loras is a good choice, but Cersei - who deeply loathes all the Tyrells - refuses to hear about it, and contemplates about appointing a Dornish for the office (because that would annoy the Tyrells).\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{King's Landing Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santagar, Aron}}\n\n[[it:Aron Santagar]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0440]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:House Santagar|Aron]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Masters-at-arms]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

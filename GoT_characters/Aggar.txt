He takes part in the [[Fall of Winterfell|assault on Winterfell]] and the hunt for [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]].\n\nAggar, alongside [[Gelmarr]] and Gynir Rednose, takes part, at Theon's orders, in the abduction and killing of the unnamed\u00a0[[Jack#In the books|miller's]] [[Billy#In the books|sons]] whose corpses are passed off as Bran's and Rickon's; their mother is also killed when she begs for mercy.\n\nOne day after they return from Acorn Water, Aggar is found dead, his throat slit ear to ear; Gelmarr\u00a0and Gynir are also killed within a few days. Later it is revealed they were secretly killed by \"Reek\" (actually, Ramsay in disguise) at Theon's command, to prevent them from revealing the truth about the slain children; since Theon needs a scapegoat, he falsely accuses\u00a0[[Farlen]]\u00a0of the killing and executes him.\n\nIn ''A Dance with Dragons'', when some men mysteriously die one by one at Winterfell, Theon is reminded of Aggar, Gelmarr, and Gynir.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n\n\n\n[[de:Aggar]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0433\u0433\u0430\u0440]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

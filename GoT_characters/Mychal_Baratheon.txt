Writer [[Bryan Cogman]] said that he filled in much of this by simply making up names or using in-jokes - and these aren't strictly canon. On the other hand, some of the details are accurate to the novels, such as information on the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], do match the already released novels.\n\nOne of the entries visible in the book says that one of Orys's sons died preventing an assassination attempt on King Aenys - the prop names this son Mychal Baratheon. In the books, a Baratheon by the name of Raymont Baratheon served in Aenys's kingsguard. It is unclear if this was behind-the-scenes information that [[George R.R. Martin]] shared with Cogman, or if he simply ''guessed'' that one of Aenys's Kingsguard may have died fighting off an assassination attempt in the Faith Militant uprising (the details of which weren't specified until some time after Season 1 was produced).\n\nIn the print material so far, it is unclear if Raymont Baratheon died defending Aenys during the Faith Militant's attack on the Red Keep. Moreover, it is not specifically clear if he was Orys's son or his grandson - only that he was the son of a \"Lord Baratheon\".\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n*{{AWOIAF|Raymont Baratheon}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Mychal}}\n[[de:Mychal Baratheon]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

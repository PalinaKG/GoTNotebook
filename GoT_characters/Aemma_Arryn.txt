In 93 AC she married her cousin [[Viserys I Targaryen]], who ascended to the [[Iron Throne]] following the death of her grandfather, as he had been chosen as the heir to the throne during the Great Council of 101 AC.\n\nShe became pregnant several times during the early years of their marriage, but suffered several miscarriages and gave birth to one son who later died in the cradle. She eventually gave birth to a healthy daughter, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], in 97 AC, and both of her parents adored her. Aemma became pregnant again in 105 AC, though she died in childbirth and her son Baelon died the following day.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Arryn navbox}}\n{{HotD/Targaryen navbox}}\n}}\n[[fr:Aemma Arryn]]\n[[de:Aemma Arryn]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0439\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u0410\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d]]\n[[ro:Aemma Arryn]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arryn, Aemma}}\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Arryn]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

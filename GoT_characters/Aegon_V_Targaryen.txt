He was the father of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] and his sister-wife Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]]; grandfather of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], and [[Daenerys Targaryen]]; great-grandfather of [[Jon Snow]]; and younger brother of Maester [[Aemon]]. In the books, he was dubbed \"the Unlikely\" because he was the third son of [[Maekar Targaryen]], who was in turn the fourth son of [[Daeron II Targaryen]], and thus Aegon was highly unlikely to have inherited the crown.\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\n[[File:Dunk and Egg.png|thumb|right||Aegon riding alongside Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] in his youth.]]\nAs the youngest son of King Maekar and Queen [[Dyanna Dayne|Dyanna]], Aegon was not originally expected to succeed his father to the throne, but after his older brother [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion]] died, and his next older brother [[Aemon]] refused the throne due to his vows as a [[Order of Maesters|maester]], the crown passed to him. Aemon then joined the [[Night's Watch]] to remove himself from the royal court, where he might be used as a political tool against his brother.\n\nStarting as a child, Aegon V began an odd friendship with the [[hedge knight]] Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. He became Duncan's squire, and they had many adventures across Westeros. Eventually, after Aegon V came to the throne he named Ser Duncan to the [[Kingsguard]], and in time he became its [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]]. He later sent his army to deal with [[Maelys Blackfyre]] during the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]].\n\nAfter ruling for many years, Aegon V ultimately died along with Ser Duncan the Tall in the [[Tragedy at Summerhall]] when he attempted to hatch new [[dragon]] eggs using fire and sorcery. Instead, it caused a fire that spread out of control and destroyed the entire palace. Aegon V died in the conflagration, and was succeeded by his son [[Aerys II Targaryen]].<ref>\"[[Dragons]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nAt [[Castle Black]], Maester Aemon reveals to [[Jon Snow]] that his father was Maekar, and after their father died the crown passed to his brother Aegon, because Aemon refused the throne due to his vows as a maester.

It mentions how he took Prince Aegon V as his squire and defended him once.<ref>\"[[The Iron Throne]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFor the TV series, the Targaryen lineage was simplified. In the books, there were seventeen Targaryen kings that ruled the Seven Kingdoms, rather than the show having sixteen. After the death of Aegon V, his son Jaehaerys inherited the throne as Jaehaerys II and ruled for three years before dying of grief. After Jaehaerys's death, his son the Mad King took over as the last Targaryen king. This would make Aegon V the grandfather of the Mad King, the great-grandfather of Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys Targaryen, and great-great-grandfather of Jon Snow.\n\nSo far, it has not been confirmed in the series if Aegon V's daughter Rhaelle did marry into House Baratheon, giving the Baratheons their claim to the throne in the TV series as well as in the books, or if the entire progeny of Aegon V has been replaced with just Aerys and Rhaella. The [[HBO]] Viewer's Guide confirms the existence of [[Duncan Targaryen]] in the TV show (making him Aerys and Rhaella's brother instead of their uncle), though in the [[Complete Guide to Westeros]] video '''\"[[House Baratheon (Complete Guide to Westeros)|House Baratheon]]\"''', Robert states that his claim to the throne was based on his descent from [[Orys Baratheon]], said to be a half-brother of [[Aegon I Targaryen]].\n\nAnother issue that could arise due to the removal of Jaehaerys II is the Mad King's [[Targaryen madness|insanity]]. In the books, Aegon V married Betha of [[House Blackwood]]. If this turns out to be the case in the TV series, it would be a stretch to say that Aerys succumbed to insanity due to multiple generations of incest as he would then be descended from three Targaryens who married outside the family (though Aegon V's brother, [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion Brightflame]] suffered from the madness despite being the issue of a marriage between a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] and a [[House Dayne|Dayne]] as did their uncle [[Rhaegel Targaryen|Rhaegel]] despite being the issue of a marriage between a Targaryen and a [[House Martell|Martell]]). There remains a possibility that Aegon did have a sister he married in the TV continuity.\n\n==In the books==\nAegon V Targaryen is a major character in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' prequel novellas, which are set around ninety years before the events of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.\n\nAegon, using the alias \"Egg\", spent many years traveling the Seven Kingdoms as a squire in the service of Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], a hedge knight. At their first meeting Duncan was unaware of Egg's true identity, until he used his royal authority to save Duncan from being killed by his bullying older brother, Prince Aerion. Duncan was able to instead face Aerion on the [[tournament]] field and defeat him in combat. Unfortunately, Prince [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen]], the royal heir, was killed during the tournament. Prince [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]] - Aegon's father - despaired of Aerion's spoiled indolence and agreed to let Aegon serve as Duncan's squire to build character and gain experience of living in the \"real\" world.\n\nAegon ascended to the [[Iron Throne]] in 233 AC, following his father Maekar's death in battle with an outlaw lord. Of Aegon's three older brothers, the eldest Daeron (who appears to have been omitted from the show) died of a pox, Aerion had poisoned himself to death (by ill-advisedly drinking [[wildfire]], thinking it might turn him into a [[dragon]]), and Aemon had disinherited himself by first joining the [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] and later the [[Night's Watch]]. As Aegon V Targaryen, he ruled for twenty-six years. During this time he made Ser Duncan the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] and secured an alliance between the Targaryens and [[House Baratheon]] by wedding his daughter Rhaelle to the then-Lord of [[Storm's End]], [[Ormund Baratheon]]. She later became the grandmother of [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]], giving Robert Baratheon his claim to the Iron Throne when he later rebelled against the Targaryens. Aegon V married Betha of [[House Blackwood]] and had three sons, [[Duncan Targaryen|Duncan]] (often called Duncan the Small), Jaehaerys, and Daeron, as well as his two daughters Shaera and Rhaelle.\n\nBeing the fourth son of a fourth son, Aegon V was known as \"the Unlikely\" because he was unlikely to have inherited the crown. Actually, given that two of his uncles had twin sons, Aegon was initially ''twelfth'' in line to the throne when he was born during the reign of his grandfather Daeron II. Even after his father was crowned, he was still fourth in line for many years.\n\nAegon V ruled wisely and well, but he had three major weaknesses. The first was that due to his years traveling across Westeros with Ser Duncan, he gained a great concern for the welfare of the [[smallfolk]], yet opinions about this varied. Commoners remember him as a great king who was genuinely concerned about their well-being, who ensured their economic livelihoods by raising taxes on aristocrats and wealthy merchants, and who punished lords who abused the rights of the commoners they ruled over. The nobility of the Seven Kingdoms, meanwhile, grew to resent Aegon V - for exactly the same reasons.\n\nSecond, Aegon V indulged his sons: having married for love himself, he permitted his sons to do the same, although this was not politically wise and made him enemies within the Seven Kingdoms. The nobility was already growing to resent him for his liberal policies with the smallfolk, and a marriage-alliance with one of the Great Houses would have helped to stabilize Targaryen rule. Duncan the Small famously abdicated his place in the line of succession to marry a commoner, Jenny of Oldstones (a story which has become a favorite theme of romantic songs, which gave [[Sansa Stark]] an idealized vision of courtly love). Shaera was supposed to marry [[Luthor Tyrell]], Jaehaerys was supposed to marry a Tully girl, and Daeron was supposed to marry the young [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna Redwyne]]. Aegon V was determined to put an end to the incestuous marriage practices of the Targaryens but this only seemed to encourage a forbidden romance between Jaehaerys and Shaera, who eloped and married without his permission. Daeron, a splendid and brave knight, did not want to marry Olenna either - and is heavily implied to be homosexual in ''The World of Ice & Fire''. Thus after his two older brothers broke their betrothals he broke his as well, saying that his father could not rightfully force him to marry against his will when he had already relented for his two elder brothers. Olenna Redwyne was then free to marry Lord Luthor, becoming Olenna Tyrell.\n\nThird, Aegon V also had an overwhelming obsession with hatching the surviving Targaryen dragon eggs. He encountered so much resistance from the Great Houses over the years trying to enact reforms that would benefit the smallfolk that he came to believe that the only way to bring them all in line again was to enforce royal power with new dragons. These last two weaknesses culminated in 259 AC at the so-called \"[[Tragedy at Summerhall]]\". This was a fire that got out of control and destroyed the castle, killing Aegon V, Ser Duncan the Tall, and Prince Duncan the Small. On the same night, Aegon's great-grandson [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] was born. Aegon V was succeeded by his son Jaehaerys II, who was the actual father of Aerys II.\n\n===Potential adaptation===\nOn February 10, 2013, George R.R. Martin confirmed that he had been in discussion with [[HBO]] over a possible adaptation of the ''Dunk and Egg'' short stories, though in what format (TV movies, theatrical movie, or a spin-off TV series) was not made clear.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/ASoWS/News/Entry/Tuf_Voyaging_Reissued_TV_Project_Discussed Westeros.org]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{Kings of Westeros navbox}}\n\n[[de:Aegon V.

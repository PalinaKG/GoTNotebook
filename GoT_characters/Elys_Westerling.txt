I knew at once when I saw the way they looked at me. It would be blame. Lannister or no, I'd been one of Aerys's Kingsguard. I commanded them to announce that the Mad King was dead and to spare all those who yielded. They asked me if they should proclaim a new king as well. I knew what they meant. Would it be my father, or Robert Baratheon, or maybe the child Viserys who'd fled to Dragonstone?|[[Jaime Lannister]]|Robert's Rebellion (Histories & Lore)}}\n'''Elys Westerling''' was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Westerling]] during the reign of [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. He participated in the [[Sack of King's Landing]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] killed the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], Ser Elys and more of [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s knights entered the [[Red Keep]] hall, and saw Jaime standing over Aerys's body. They incorrectly assumed Jaime killed the king in order to give the throne to his father, and asked him whether they should proclaim a new king. Jaime considered naming [[Viserys II Targaryen|Viserys]], but fearing that the boy would grow to be like his monstrous grandfather, he just said \"Proclaim who you bloody well like\".<ref>\"[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories & Lore)|Robert's Rebellion]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Elys Westerling is mentioned only once and very briefly, in Jaime's flashback about the aforementioned event, as narrated in [[Histories & Lore]].\n\nIt is unknown whether Ser Elys is still alive, and what is his exact kinship to the main branch of House Westerling.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Westerling, Elys}}\n[[Category:House Westerling|Elys, Westerling]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

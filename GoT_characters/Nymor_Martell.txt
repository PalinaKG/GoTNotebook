Aegon, who had endured a long conflict with Meria, granted the request.<ref>\"[[House Martell, Princes of Dorne]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Nymor was already old and weak by the time he ascended to the throne of [[Dorne]]. He sent his daughter and heir, Princess Deria Martell, to lead a delegation to [[King's Landing]] to negotiate a peace with King [[Aegon I Targaryen]]. Nymor gave her a letter to deliver to Aegon, who had intended to refuse the treaty, but upon reading it the dragon king clenched it so hand that his hands began to bleed, burned it once he had finished and flew to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] on [[Balerion]] without a word. He returned the next morning, agreed to the peace and signed the treaty.\n\nThe contents of Nymor's latter were never confirmed and were a topic of much speculation among [[Order of Maesters|maesters]]. Some believe that Nymor wrote that Aegon's sister-wife [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] had not died at [[Hellholt]] but was alive, crippled and in great pain, and that her suffering would be ended if Aegon signed the treaty. Another theory is that Nymor threatened to hire a [[Faceless Man]] to kill Aegon's son and heir Prince [[Aenys Targaryen]] if he did not agree to the peace. Regardless of the reason, the peace lasted for the remainder of Aegon's reign.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martell, Nymor}}\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Princes of Dorne]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Instead, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to war. [[House Stark]] and [[House Baratheon]] followed suit. The rebels forged an alliance with [[House Tully]] through marriage, with Eddard married to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]] and the then-elderly Jon to the young [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa Tully]].<ref name=\"Jon Arryn viewers guide\"/><ref name=\"E1\">\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Jon_Arryn_Hand.png|thumb|left|Jon Arryn serving as Hand of the King.]]After the rebel victory in the war, Robert acceded to the throne and appointed Jon as his [[Hand of the King|Hand]].

Pycelle states that Jon Arryn intended to act and reveal his discovery to King Robert. When Tyrion accuses Pycelle of having Jon poisoned to keep the truth from getting out, he angrily denies that he killed him.

This scene was not filmed for the [[Game of Thrones pilot episode|pilot episode]] in favor of retaining the opening of the novel. Jon Arryn was played in these scenes by [[John Standing]].\n\nIn a November 2015 interview, Standing described the death scene he filmed: Jon Arryn is feverish and bedridden (from being poisoned), but with a last desperate burst of strength he drags himself across the floor from his bed to a writing desk, and from the ground he reaches for the pen and ink on it. As he pulls it down his strength fails him, however, and he ends up spilling the ink pot all over himself. In his last seconds of life he feebly attempts to move his hand to write something with the pen - only for Cersei Lannister ([[Lena Headey]]) to stamp on his fingers to stop him, at which he dies from the poison. Standing said that filming was difficult because he found out the night before that his younger brother had died (though filming had been scheduled for weeks in advance).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEiUPb0iUWQ ]</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jon Arryn is a great lord, wise counselor, and canny tactician. He is loved as a second father by both Eddard and Robert, and commanded great respect in the [[Vale of Arryn]]. His nephew and heir Elbert Arryn was among [[Brandon Stark (son of Rickard)|Brandon Stark]]'s companions who were imprisoned and killed by the Mad King, sparking Jon Arryn's decision to join the rebellion.\n\nJon Arryn's first wife, Lady Jeyne Royce, died in childbirth, and their daughter was stillborn. His second wife, Rowena, died without issue. Lysa Tully, some forty years his junior, became his third wife as part of an alliance with Lord [[Hoster Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. The marriage was loveless and produced only one surviving child, the sickly Robert.\n\nIn the books, [[Eddard Stark]] discovered that Arryn and [[Stannis Baratheon]] inquired together about Cersei's children and Robert's bastards. In fact it was Stannis who initiated the investigation, while in the TV series he is not mentioned at all in respect of Arryn's actions prior to his death \u2013 this was likely changed so that TV-first viewers weren't confused about the actions of yet another unseen character.\n\nWhen Tyrion confronts Pycelle with his guards, Pycelle admits that Jon Arryn was being treated by maester Colemon, who gave him purges to get the poison out; that treatment might have cured Arryn. Pycelle, aware that Arryn knew the secret of Cersei's incest, sent the other maester away and just gave Arryn [[Milk of the Poppy|painkillers]] to ease his passing. In the TV series the emphasis is slightly different: Pycelle presents it as that he simply didn't intervene when he realized Lord Arryn was poisoned, though Tyrion points out that even his inaction when he could have saved Lord Arryn makes him an accomplice to the murder. In the TV series, Tyrion just vaguely asserts that Pycelle must have \"made sure he succumbed\", but in the book version he goes slightly beyond inaction, deliberately dismissing a maester who might have saved him.\n\nEven in the books, Pycelle didn't know who actually poisoned Jon Arryn, but it was convenient for Pycelle that someone else poisoned him before he had to deal with it.\n\nIn the book, Lysa blurts out the whole truth about Arryn's death while she is dragging [[Sansa Stark]] to the Moon Door. Littlefinger tries in vain to hush Lysa, feeling uncomfortable that she reveals this secret in the presence of Sansa and [[Marillion]].\n\nLysa's reason for poisoning Jon is actually a little less obsessive, but just as selfish: he planned on having their son sent to Dragonstone to be fostered by Stannis Baratheon, in keeping with accepted tradition for noble boys in the Seven Kingdoms and the fact that Stannis was the only one \u2013 aside from Ned \u2013 he could trust. This didn't matter at all to Lysa of course, as she could not bear the thought of being separated from her son.\n\nLittlefinger apparently wanted Arryn dead to trick the Starks and Lannisters into fighting each other (aided by the letter he had Lysa write to Catelyn), and also so he could later marry Lysa and take control of the Vale. Thus while the situation was the same in the books, Lysa's motivation and Pycelle's role were a little more complicated.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Tasa|{{Arryn navbox}}|{{SmallCouncil navbox}}}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arryn, Jon}}\n\n[[de:Jon Arryn]]\n[[es:Jon Arryn]]\n[[fr:Jon Arryn]]\n[[it:Jon Arryn]]\n[[pl:Jon Arryn]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0410\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u743c\u6069\u00b7\u827e\u6797]]\n[[Category:Small council]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Wardens]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Eyrie|Jon Arryn]]\n[[Category:Members of House Arryn]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

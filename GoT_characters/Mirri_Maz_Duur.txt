She's also a ''[[maegi]]'', a practitioner of [[blood magic]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Mirri Maz Duur 1x09.png|thumb|Mirri Maz Duur prepares to sacrifice Drogo's horse]]\n\nDuur's village is raided by the [[Dothraki]] [[khalasar]] under Khal [[Drogo]]. The captive women are taken into slavery and raped. The Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]] orders that the [[Lhazareen]] women - including Mirri Maz Duur - be handed over to her custody to protect them. One of Drogo's warriors, [[Mago]], objects. When Drogo agrees to Daenerys' request, Mago challenges Drogo to single combat. Drogo kills Mago, but takes a minor [[arakh]] wound to his chest. Mirri Maz Duur volunteers to heal the wound, saying that she is a godswife, or priestess of the Lhazareen god, the Great Shepherd. Drogo's bloodrider [[Qotho]] objects, calling Duur a ''[[maegi]]'' - a witch - but Drogo accepts her offering at Dany's urging.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n[[File:Mirri 1x10.png|thumb|Mirri Maz Duur awaits her death]]\nIn spite of - or maybe because of - Mirri Maz Duur's attentions, Drogo's wound becomes infected, making him seriously ill, and he falls from his horse, a sign of weakness among the Dothraki that threatens his position of ''khal''. Duur claims that she can save him, but requires a blood sacrifice. She suggests killing [[Red|Drogo's horse]]. Qotho becomes enraged at her use of magic to save Drogo and tries to stop the ceremony, but is killed by Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]. Daenerys is thrown to the ground during the fight and goes into labor, so Mormont takes her into the tent where Duur is carrying out the ceremony \u2013 in spite of Duur's strict warning not to interrupt \u2013 to ask for her aid.<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen Daenerys awakens she learns that her son was stillborn and malformed. She finds [[Drogo]] alive but in a vegetative state. Daenerys asks desperately when will Drogo be as he was, and Duur answers: \"''When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east, when the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves''\". Duur explains that Daenerys got what she traded for, and that before she was \"saved\" by Daenerys, she had already been raped several times and her temple had been burned. Now thanks to her spell, neither Drogo nor [[Rhaego|his son]] will cause any more suffering. Daenerys builds a funeral pyre for Drogo and orders Jorah to bind Duur to the pyre. The ''maegi'' claims she won't scream. She begins chanting as the flames slowly engulf her, though her singing quickly changes to shrieks of pain as she is burnt alive. True to Daenerys's word, Duur dies screaming.<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nAt [[Vaes Dothrak]], Daenerys tells [[Moro]] and other present khals that she has been there before, and the [[Dosh khaleen]] pronounced her child the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]]. Moro contemptuously responds that she trusted a sorceress, like a fool, and that led to the deaths of her child and Drogo.<ref>\"[[Book of the Stranger]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]]===\nMirri is briefly referred to by Daenerys when she explains to [[Jon Snow]] that she cannot have any children. Jon points out that the \"witch who killed her husband and cursed her\" is not a particularly reliable source of information as to her current health.<ref>\"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]\"</ref>\n\n== Abilities ==\n'''Blood Magic'''\n\nMirri Maz Duur was a ''[[maegi]]'', and thus had the knowledge and power to perform [[blood magic]], as shown with her ritual on ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] to presumably resurrect him, which actually left him in a persistent vegetative state.\n\n'''Healing Magic'''\n\nBeing a [[Lhazareen]] [[godswife]], Mirri Maz Duur would have possessed a wide range of knowledge and skill concerning how to perform various forms of healing magic and spells.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=yes|9=yes|10=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nMirri Maz Duur's role in the series is largely unchanged from the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, with the books giving more details about her history. She is the godswife of a Lhazareen village and is rumored to have unearthly powers. Her mother had been a godswife before her and taught her all the spells and songs. As a young girl, Mirri had traveled to [[Asshai]] to learn the arts of the [[shadowbinder]]s. She also studied the lore of the moonsingers of the Jogos Nhai, the herb lore of the Dothraki, and medicines and anatomy with the then-travelling [[Archmaester]] Marwyn.\n\nDuur's treachery makes Daenerys reluctant to trust [[Quaithe]], who, among other things, seems to imply that Daenerys should visit Asshai next. When Daenerys was at the [[House of the Undying]], one of the prophecies she heard was \"Three treasons will you know, once for blood and once for gold and once for love\". Daenerys believes that Mirri Maz Duur committed the blood treason.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Duur, Mirri Maz}}\n\n\n[[de:Mirri Maz Duur]]\n[[es:Mirri Maz Duur]]\n[[it:Mirri Maz Duur]]\n[[pl:Mirri Maz Duur]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0440\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0437 \u0414\u0443\u0443\u0440]]\n[[zh:\u5f25\u4e3d\u00b7\u9a6c\u5179\u00b7\u7b03\u5c14]]\n[[Category:Slaves and freedmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Lhazareen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

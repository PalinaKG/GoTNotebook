Ser Addam's scouts have noticed [[Robb Stark]]'s forces have crossed the [[Neck]] and are moving south along the east bank of the Green Fork of the [[Trident]].<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref> Tywin's forces later engage and defeat the Stark force in the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. The Stark army is much smaller than the scouts reported because they separated at the [[Twins]].<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\nSer Addam is present for a strategy meeting with Tywin following the defeat in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] by the main portion of the Stark army. Also present are [[Tyrion Lannister|Tywin]], [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], [[Leo Lefford]], [[Harys Swyft]] and another [[Lannister bannerman 2|bannerman]], as well as Tywin's servant and several Lannister officers. He asks about [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]], and Kevan confirms that both Baratheon brothers have declared against the Lannisters. Later he dismisses suing for a truce so as to not appear weak, and proposes that they march against the Starks instead. Tywin dismisses his bannermen and then announces plans to relocate to [[Harrenhal]].<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|10=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Addam Marbrand is one of the chief knights in the service of Tywin. He is a rangy man, with long, dark copper hair and wears a smoke grey cape.\n\nDuring his youth, Addam was a page at [[Casterly Rock]] and a childhood friend of [[Jaime Lannister]].\n\nSimilarly to the show, Addam attends the council that Tywin holds after the recent defeats at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the [[Battle of the Camps]]. He is against asking for a truce, stating that two battles do not make a war, and volunteers to try his own steel against \"[[Robb Stark|that Stark boy]]\". Tywin orders his host to [[Harrenhal]], dispatching Addam's outriders to screen their movements.\n\nSer Addam is one of Tywin's bannermen present at Harrenhal and departs the ruined castle a day before his liege lord. He survives the Battle of the Fords and joins Tywin in the march south when the latter receives word of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s imminent attack. After the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Addam is made Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]]. Tyrion considers this a shrewd move on his father's part, as like his brother Jaime, Addam is both a skilled commander and has the charisma to convince men to follow him into battle.\n\nAfter Jaime returns to King's Landing, he practices with Addam for a while, but fearing that Addam may get drunk and reveal what poor fighter Jaime is now, he moves to practice with [[Ilyn Payne]].\n\nAddam accompanies Jaime in his mission to resolve the siege of Riverrun. He is quite content to leave the City Watch and command the outriders. \n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Marbrand navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marbrand, Addam}}\n\n[[de:Addam Marbrand]]\n[[es:Addam Marbrand]]\n[[it:Addam Marbrand]]\n[[nl:Addam Marbrand]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0434\u0434\u0430\u043c \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u4e9a\u5f53\u00b7\u9a6c\u5c14\u5e03\u5170]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Members of House Marbrand]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

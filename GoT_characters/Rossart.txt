Rossart burned Aerys's enemies alive in the [[Great Hall]] of the [[Red Keep]]. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], he rose to Hand of the King.<ref>\"[[The Alchemists' Guild]]\"</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of the Trident]], Aerys had Rossart [[Wildfire plot|fill King's Landing with secret caches of wildfire]] in order to destroy the city and all those in it, should the capital fall to the rebels. However, Rossart was killed by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]], to prevent him from carrying out the Mad King's order of destroying the entire city.<ref name=\":0\">\"[[Kissed by Fire]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nWhile feverishly taking a bath in [[Harrenhal]] alongside [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], Jaime recalls the turn of events that led him to killing King Aerys, indirectly referring to Rossart as \"his pyromancer\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Wisdom Rossart was the head of the Alchemist's Guild during the reign of King Aerys. He had been elevated largely because he shared the king's passion for fire. He was the pyromancer who had cooked Lord [[Rickard Stark]] in his armor with wildfire.\n\nAfter Lord [[Qarlton Chelsted]] was executed\u00a0at the Mad King's orders, because he refused to take part in Aerys's plan to destroy the city and tried in vain to dissuade him, Rossart became the new Hand of the King, choosing a burning torch as his personal sigil. Rossart served as Hand for less than a fortnight, before being killed during the Sack of King's Landing. Many people, who were not in the capital at that\u00a0time, do not even remember that he was briefly Hand of the King.\n\nAfter being sent by Aerys to kill Tywin, Jaime caught up with Rossart and killed him, then he returned to the throne room and killed Aerys. Before he died, Aerys asked him whose blood was on Jaime's sword, to which Jaime replied that it was Rossart's. Jaime noted that Rossart at least tried to make a fight of it, while Aerys did not resist at all when Jaime slit his throat. Days later, Jaime hunted down the other pyromancers and slew them as well;\u00a0Belis offered him gold, and Garigus wept for mercy, but Jaime killed them anyway.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Rossart]]\n[[es:Rossart]]\n[[fr:Rossart]]\n[[it:Rossart]]\n[[nl:Rossart]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u7f57\u8428\u7279]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Alchemists' Guild]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

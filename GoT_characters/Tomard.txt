He is with Eddard when [[Renly Baratheon]] brings news of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s hunting injury. Eddard instructs Tomard to hand deliver a letter to [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Tomard is not present when Eddard and the majority of his guard are killed.<ref>\"[[You Win or You Die]]\"</ref> He escapes from the capital and successfully delivers the letter, thus he is one of very few (if any) of the Stark Household to have survived the [[Massacre in the Red Keep]]. His destination after he completes his assignment is unknown.\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|7=yes|||||||8 = |9 = |10 = }}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tomard is nicknamed Fat Tom. He is easily fooled and prone to stating the obvious. He becomes the Captain of [[Eddard Stark]]'s personal guard, following the death of [[Jory Cassel]] and the departure of Jory's replacement Alyn with Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]]. \n\nAs in the show, Tomard is entrusted to deliver a letter to [[Stannis Baratheon]], but is explicitly told to do so during a sea journey North with Eddard's daughters. Unlike in the show, [[Massacre in the Red Keep|he is killed along with the majority of the guards]] when Eddard is betrayed by [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] in the Throne Room. The letter is taken from his body, and later presented to [[Sansa Stark]] as an \"evidence\" to her father's alleged treason.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n\n[[fr:Tomard]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u6258\u9a6c\u5fb7]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

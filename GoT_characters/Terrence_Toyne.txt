And the man was one of Aegon's own Kingsguard.|[[Bronn]]|The Kingsguard}}\nSer '''Terrence Toyne''' was a renowned [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Toyne]] and member of the [[Kingsguard]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nSer Terrence Toyne was fed to the dogs of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] for sleeping with [[Bethany Bracken|one]] of his mistresses.<ref>\"[[The Kingsguard]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nTerrence Toyne is mentioned within the entry of [[Aemon Targaryen (Dragonknight)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] in the ''[[The Book of Brothers]]''. It is said that he was defeated by the Targaryen prince in the final joust in a tourney at [[Riverrun]].<ref>\"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Terrence Toyne was once found abed with [[Bethany Bracken]], one of King Aegon the Unworthy's mistresses. Even though they proclaimed love, Aegon had them executed. Toyne was dismembered piece by piece, while the mistress was forced to watch before meeting her own death.\n\nSer Terrence's brothers attempted to avenge him by killing King Aegon; they did their best, but were stopped by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who died defending him instead. They paid for their treason with their lives, and in turn this event was key in the downfall of House Toyne, which in a few generations devolved into a family of rogues and robber knights, whereas others went into exile across the [[Narrow Sea]].\n\n[[Simon Toyne]], the leader of the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], was the last of his line.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Toyne, Terrence}}\n\n\n[[de:Terrenz Toyn]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0441 \u0422\u043e\u0439\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u7279\u4f26\u65af\u00b7\u6258\u56e0]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:House Toyne|Terrence Toyne]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

His status is uncertain.\n\n==Biography==\nGilwood Hunter is the sixthborn son of Ser [[Stentey Hunter]] and [[Serena Royce]].<ref name = \"s1prop\">''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' prop from Season 1</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGilwood Hunter is mentioned in the section on House Royce in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. The section on House Royce never appears on-screen in the TV series, as its planned appearance, where [[Eddard Stark]] would have read from it, was cut.\n\n==In the books==\nGilwood Hunter appears in ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', but his genealogy is different, being the son of and heir of Lord [[Eon Hunter]], rather than of the knight Stentey Hunter (who does not exist in the book series). Gilwood is nearing fifty years old at the beginning of the book series and inherits his father's titles after Eon is suddenly murdered. The youngest son of Eon, Harlan, attempts to push the theory that it was Gilwood who killed Eon, but Petyr Baelish considers it more likely that it was Harlan himself who was behind the murder.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunter, Gilwood}}\n\n[[ru:\u0413\u0438\u043b\u0432\u0443\u0434 \u0425\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

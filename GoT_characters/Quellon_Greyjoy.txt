He would have sat out the whole war if not for my brother and me.|[[Euron Greyjoy]]|The Greyjoy Rebellion}}\nLord '''Quellon Greyjoy''' was the [[Lord of the Iron Islands]] during the reign of [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. He had three sons: [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]], [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]], and [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring [[Robert's Rebellion]], Quellon's sons Balon and Euron urged him to join the war. He sided with the rebels and sailed to the [[Reach]], where he died in [[Battle of the Mander|battle]] against [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] [[Ships|longships]]. After his death, Balon became Lord of the Iron Islands and pulled out of the war.<ref>\"[[The Greyjoy Rebellion]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Quellon was married three times and had nine sons and one stillborn daughter. His sons were named Harlon, Quenton, Donel, Balon, Euron, Victarion, Urrigon, Aeron, and Robin.\n\nQuellon has been considered one of the wisest of the Greyjoys. He stood six and a half feet tall, and was both strong and fast.\n\nAccording to ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Quellon fought corsairs and slavers in the [[Summer Sea]] as a young man and commanded a fleet of a hundred longships in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. Quellon once attacked the Farman fleet and sacked [[Faircastle]].\n\nQuellon was opposed to the [[Old Way]], and tried to assimilate the [[ironborn]] into [[Andal]] culture by freeing [[thrall]]s, forbidding most reaving, discouraging the taking of [[salt wife|salt wives]], encouraging [[marriage]] alliances with the [[Westeros|mainland]], and bringing [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] to the Isles.\n\nQuellon was succeeded by Balon, his eldest surviving son. Balon rejected most of his father's reforms, and his desire to return to the Old Way led to the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greyjoy, Quellon}}\n[[ru:\u041a\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0436\u043e\u0439]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Lords Reaper of Pyke]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Iron Islands]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

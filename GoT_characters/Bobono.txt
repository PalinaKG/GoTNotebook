Off-stage, Bobono verbally spars with his castmates and shares a drink with [[Lady Crane]].<ref>\"[[The Door]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances|5=yes|6 = yes|8=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bobono is a mummer in Izembaro's theater troupe in Braavos.\n\nIn the fourth novel, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers a reward to whoever brings her Tyrion's head, or provide information about his whereabouts. Many informers come to the [[Red Keep]], claiming knowledge of Tyrion. One of them claims that he seen Tyrion in a mummer's show in Braavos, but admits it might have been another dwarf. The dwarf in question is perhaps Bobono.\n\nBobono harasses [[Arya Stark|Arya]] by giving her leers, offering her to come to his room, and on one occasion he gropes her chest. Arya responds by twisting his nose painfully, warning him that next time he'll lose his nose.\u00a0\n\nWhile Ser [[Harys Swyft]] and his guards watch the show, Arya overhears two of the guards - one of them is Rafford, the one who murdered [[Lommy]] - arguing whether Bobono is Tyrion in disguise. Rafford says that after the show he will follow the dwarf, behead him and bring his head to Cersei; if the dwarf is not Tyrion, well, it won't be a great loss. Arya saves Bobono (although it was not her intention - she wanted to avenge Lommy's death) by luring Rafford and killing him.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Bobono}} \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}[[de:Bobono]]\n[[es:Bobono]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043d\u043e]]\n[[fr:Bobono]]\n[[Category:Bards and mummers]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

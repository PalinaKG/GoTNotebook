Following his death, he was succeeded in the position by an [[High Septon (boy)|eight-year-old boy]].<ref>\"[[Great Sept of Baelor (Histories & Lore)|Great Sept of Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the stonemason's original name was '''Pate'''. He was so skilled at his craft that [[Baelor Targaryen]] believed him to be [[the Smith]] in human form and informed the [[Most Devout]] of this, appointing him as [[High Septon]]. However, Pate could not read, write or recite prayers, and proved completely incapable of performing the duties of the head of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. He held the position for only a year before a fever took him, though it was rumored that the [[Hand of the King]], [[Prince]] [[Viserys II Targaryen|Viserys Targaryen]], poisoned him to spare the realm the embarrassment of having such an ineffectual High Septon.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[ru:\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043d (\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a)]]\n[[Category:High Septons]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

At the onset of the [[War of the Five Kings]], he pledged his allegiance to Renly Baratheon, the [[Lord of Storm's End]] and [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\n[[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Renly Baratheon]]'s camp is a hive of activity as his troops prepare for the coming battle with the forces of King [[Stannis Baratheon]]. The camp is beset by strong winds. At night, Lady [[Catelyn Stark]] meets with King Renly in his command tent.\n[[File:Brienne kills.jpg|thumb|left|Brienne kills Robar Royce.]]\nSer Robar and his sworn brother, Ser [[Emmon Cuy]], are outside while [[Brienne of Tarth]] stands watch inside the tent. Hearing Brienne scream, the guards rush into the tent with swords in hand. They see Brienne kneeling over Renly\u2019s corpse and assume that she is responsible. They threaten her life. Catelyn tries to intervene but they push her aside. Brienne fights them off, killing both.<ref>\"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|5=yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Royce family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Robar Royce is a member of Renly's Rainbow Guard as \"Robar the Red\", the second son of Lord [[Yohn Royce]] of [[Runestone]] after Ser Andar Royce and older brother of [[Waymar Royce]] of the [[Night's Watch]]. He is first seen in [[King's Landing]] at the Tourney of the Hand with his father and Ser Andar where he wears steel armor with ancient bronze runes that are supposed to have mystical powers of protection. He unhorses freerider [[Lothor Brune]], but is then defeated by Ser [[Loras Tyrell]].\n\nWhen [[Eddard Stark]] sends Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] after Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], who is terrorizing the [[riverlands]], Ser Robar is sent to the [[kingswood]] to inform the King who is hunting with others, including Lord Yohn Royce. Ser Robar and his father return to King's Landing from the hunt before Robert's fatal encounter with the boar.\n\nIn Renly's camp he tells Catelyn Stark as he escorts her to the [[sept]] that the reason that he had joined Renly was to seek the glory he would never find as the second son of a noble house and he was weary of being in tournaments. Catelyn Stark guesses him to be about 21 years old. When Renly names him to his Rainbow Guard he names him the red knight Robar the Red. At the feast at [[Bitterbridge]], Ser Bryce Caron dares him to juggle daggers.\n\nWhen Renly is murdered, Brienne's scream causes Ser Robar and Ser Emmon Cuy and two guards to rush into the tent. They arrive just after Renly's assassination to find Brienne bending over his body and covered in his blood. Cuy blames Brienne for the death and he and the other two guards attack her. Catelyn Stark convinces Robar that Brienne is innocent. He tells Lady Catelyn to get her away and he fights off the men-at-arms that follow Cuy, while Catelyn uses an iron brazier to knock Emmon Cuy unconscious, then she and Brienne escape. Ser Robar and Ser Emmon are subsequently killed in a fit of rage by their Lord Commander, Ser [[Loras Tyrell]], for their failure to protect their king.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{RenlyKingsguard navbox}}\n{{Royce navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Royce, Robar}}\n[[de:Robar Rois]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440 \u0420\u043e\u0439\u0441]]\n[[zh:\u7f57\u62d4\u00b7\u7f57\u4f0a\u65af]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard of Renly Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Royce]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

In [[Tyrion Lannister]]'s [[trial by combat]], he was the champion for [[Lysa Arryn]] and was killed by [[Bronn]], who fought for Tyrion.\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nVardis Egen was captain of [[Jon Arryn]]'s personal guard in [[King's Landing]] and then became captain of the guards in the Eyrie for [[Robin Arryn]] and his mother, [[Lysa Arryn]]. He is a knight of some reputation, but is no longer a young man.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nVardis leads the group of knights who meet [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and her prisoner Tyrion before she enters the Eyrie. Lysa orders Tyrion imprisoned in the sky cells.<ref>\"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]\"</ref>\n\nAfter spending some time in a sky cell, Tyrion demands a [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]]. Though many men offer to fight as Lysa's champion, she asks Ser Vardis to represent [[House Arryn]], and he accepts. In the ensuing duel, he is killed and thrown through the Mon Door by [[Bronn]].\n\n[[File:Bronn defeats Vardis.jpg|thumb|Vardis is thrown through the Moon Door.]]\nLysa snaps angrily to Bronn that he didn't fight with honor. The sellsword agrees, before pointing to the Moon Door and noting that Ser Vardis did, which is effectively what got him killed.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|5=yes|6=yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nVale knights.jpg|Ser Vardis leads a column of [[Knighthood|knights]] flying the banner of House Arryn through the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]].

He had been the captain of the guard when Jon Arryn was [[Hand of the King]]. He is described as heavy, square, plain-faced, silver-haired, and having no humor. He has one young son.\n\nIn the battle with Bronn, Vardis loses not only because he is a bit older and slower than Bronn, but also because Lysa gives him Jon Arryn's great sword to defend the honor of the House, which is a heavier and unfamiliar blade. \n\nIn the book, Bronn kills Vardis without pushing him out of the Moon Door (which is set in the wall, not in the floor).\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Arryn navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Egen, Vardis}}\n[[de:Vardis Egen]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0441 \u0418\u0433\u0435\u043d]]\n[[fr:Vardis Egen]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Captains of the Guards|Egen, Vardis]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

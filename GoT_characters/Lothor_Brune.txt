A freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.|[[Tourney herald]]|The North Remembers}}\n'''Lothor Brune''' is a [[Mercenary#Freeriders|freerider]], formerly in the service of Lord [[Petyr Baelish]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nLothor Brune participates in the [[tourney]] of King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s sixteenth [[nameday]]. He is set to duel Ser [[Dontos Hollard]], but the fight is forfeited when Ser Dontos appears drunk.<ref>\"[[The North Remembers]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|1=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Lothor Brune is a relative of [[House Brune]] of Brownhollow. He is a quiet, loyal man of middle age described as having has a squashed nose, a square jaw and grey hair. He is stocky and strong, and while not a handsome man he is not ugly either. In the books he was also present at the Tourney of the Hand, defeating [[Jory Cassel]] on a judgment by the [[Robert Baratheon|King]], tied with Ser [[Aron Santagar]] and lost to Ser [[Robar Royce]]. He tips off Petyr Baelish about Sansa Stark's request to spare Ser [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]] at King Joffrey's 13th nameday. He also takes part in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and is awarded with a [[knighthood]] afterwards, earning the nickname \"Apple-Eater\" for capturing a knight of [[House Fossoway]] and killing two more on the battlefield.\n\nWhen Ser Dontos spirits Sansa out of King's Landing after the [[Purple Wedding]], Lothor is present on Petyr's ship, and commanded the team of crossbowmen that kill Dontos Hollard at Baelish's order (coincidentally, the same man Lothor was supposed to face at Joffrey's tournament). Lothor throws a burning torch on the rowing boat after Dontos is murdered, ensuring that his body is never recovered. He accompanies Littlefinger to his keep at the Fingers and later to the [[Eyrie]].\n\nIn the books, Joffrey's nameday tournament in which Dontos and Lothor are set to fight is held between men fighting on horseback. Possibly due to budgetary and time constraints, in the TV series they are preparing to fight on foot. This makes it somewhat of a misnomer that Lothar is specifically introduced as a \"freerider\" but he isn't fighting on horse.\n\nWhile Sansa stays at the Vale, she notices Lothor is fond of Mya Stone, [[Robert Baratheon]]'s eldest bastard (was excluded from the TV series). She thinks Lothor would be a good match for Mya. Lothor also prevents Sansa Stark from being raped by Marillion.\n\nLothor is present when Harrold Hardyng, to whom Littlefinger plans to marry his \"daughter\", talks rudely to her, nearly bringing her to tears. Later, Lothor comforts Sansa by commenting \"Harry the Heir? Harry the Arse, I say. He\u2019s just some upjumped squire\". Sansa thanks him.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baelish navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brune, Lothar}}\n[[de:Lothor Brunn]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0411\u0440\u044e\u043d]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Baelish]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

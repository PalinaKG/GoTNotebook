She married a Lord of Storm's End, either [[Lyonel Baratheon]] or his son [[Ormund Baratheon]], and was an ancestor (grandmother or great-grandmother) of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his brothers [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nShe is mentioned under [[Lyonel Baratheon]]'s entry in ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\" ([[:File:Steffon.jpg|see image]])</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLyonel Baratheon's entry in the prop for ''The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms'' was written during production of the first season of ''Game of Thrones'', which was released in 2011. His son, Ormund Baratheon, was first introduced in the book series with ''The World of Ice and Fire'' in 2014. The Season 1 prop establishes Lyonel Baratheon as the husband of Rhaelle Targaryen and father of Steffon Baratheon, but subsequent [[Histories & Lore]] featurettes established Ormund as Steffon's father. With the effective retcon of Steffon's father, it is unclear if Rhaelle Targaryen married Ormund as in the book series (as she is listed in the prop as Steffon's father) or Lyonel (her husband per the prop).\n\n==In the books==\nIn the novels, Rhaelle Targaryen was a daughter of King [[Aegon V Targaryen]] (her exact relations to the royal family are not made clear in the TV series prop for ''The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms''). Because Lyonel was a faithful supporter of Aegon V as the Lord of Storm's End, Aegon was pleased to arrange the betrothal of his eldest son and heir, Prince [[Duncan Targaryen|Duncan]], to Lyonel's daughter. However, Prince Duncan broke the betrothal when he fell in love with and married the commoner [[Jenny of Oldstones]]. The outraged Lyonel felt that the honor of House Baratheon had been insulted, and rose in rebellion against the [[Iron Throne]], declaring himself [[Storm King]]. A short rebellion followed, but this was ended when Ser Duncan the Tall, now [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], defeated Lyonel in a trial by combat. Prince Duncan renounced his claim to the throne, and Aegon agreed to betroth his youngest daughter, Princess Rhaelle, to Lyonel's heir, [[Ormund Baratheon]]. Rhaelle was sent to Storm's End to serve as Lyonel's cupbearer and companion to his wife. It is through Rhaelle that Robert Baratheon can later legally justify his claim to the throne; with King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]], [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] and Rhaegar's children dead, Robert was legally third in line to the throne (only behind [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]).\n\nIn the TV series continuity, Rhaelle was the wife of Lyonel rather than Ormund, with the result being that she was Robert's great-grandmother rather than grandmother. The reasons for this change are unknown; it might be a case of the TV writers just filling in the gaps of knowledge for the prop book or it could be related to the removal of King Jaehaerys II Targaryen from the TV series continuity (who in the books is the son of Aegon V and father of Aerys II; in the series Aegon V is Aerys II's father) and its effects on the Targaryen genealogy and timeline.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Rhaelle}}\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n\n[[ru:\u0420\u0435\u0439\u043b\u044c \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

He died in the fighting at the [[Stepstones]], and according to singers, he spent his dying moments in the arms of his son, Steffon.<ref>\"[[War of the Ninepenny Kings (Histories & Lore)]]\"</ref>\n\nEither Ormund, or his father Lyonel, married Princess [[Rhaelle Targaryen]].<ref name = \"s1prop\">''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' prop from Season 1 lists Rhaelle Targaryen as the wife of Lyonel, but the mother of Steffon. Season 1 was produced before Ormund Baratheon was introduced in the book series, explaining the retcon. In the books, she was the wife of Ormund.</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nAccording to the TV series continuity, the Mad King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]] succeeded his father King [[Aegon V]], while the book series continuity adds a generation. King Aerys II's father was King Jaehaerys II, second son of King Aegon V. As per the prop of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', Ormund's father, [[Lyonel Baratheon]], married [[Rhaelle Targaryen]] (rather than Ormund marrying her as in the book series) in the TV series continuity, Ormund being her son rather than her husband.\n\nOrmund was the son and heir of Lord [[Lyonel Baratheon]]. His father rebelled against the [[Iron Throne]] and declared himself [[Storm King]] upon King Aegon V's eldest son and heir Prince [[Duncan Targaryen]] spurning his betrothal to Lyonel's daughter by eloping with someone else. The rebellion only ended when Ormund himself was betrothed to the King's daughter Princess Rhaelle Targaryen. Ormund later became [[Hand of the King]] to Princess Rhaelle's brother King Jaehaerys II. When the threat of [[Maelys Blackfyre]] became apparent, Jaehaerys II sent a large force to defeat him at the [[Stepstones]], and was willing to take command himself. However, Lord Ormund dissuaded him and took command instead.\n\nWhile fighting at the Stepstones at the head of the royal forces, Ormund was killed by Maelys and died in the arms of his and Princess Rhaelle's son, Steffon. Command of the royal forces passed to Ser [[Gerold Hightower]], [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Ormund}}\n[[de:Ormund Baratheon]]\n[[es:Ormund Baratheon]]\n[[it:Ormund Baratheon]]\n[[nl:Ormund Baratheon]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0440\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0434 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u8499\u5fb7\u00b7\u62dc\u62c9\u5e2d\u6069]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Lords of Storm's End]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

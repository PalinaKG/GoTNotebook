He lived roughly between 40 and 105 years before the events of the series, and was [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] of the [[Kingsguard]] when Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] started his rise to prominence. He is immortalized in many songs and stories.\n\nHis personal sigil, seen in his entry in the ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', was a shooting star over an elm tree proper, on a orange-yellow background.<ref name=\"E31\">\"[[Two Swords]]\"</ref><ref name=\":0\">\"[[The Iron Throne]]\"</ref>\n\nDuncan was born in [[Flea Bottom]] to a family whose surname is unknown. He squired for Ser [[Arlan of Pennytree]] in his teenage years, and was knighted by him at the age of 16.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nHis adventures began during the tourney at [[Ashford]], which led to him fighting in a [[Trial by seven of Duncan the Tall|trial by combat]] against Prince [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion \"Brightflame\" Targaryen]]. Aerion demanded a rare [[trial by seven]] - a seven man team led by Duncan against a seven man team led by Aerion, considered very dangerous, but Duncan won the day. This indirectly led to the death of the [[Prince of Dragonstone]], [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen]], from a concussion dealt by an accidental blow from his own brother Prince [[Maekar Targaryen]], who was also Aerion's father, during the [[trial by seven of Duncan the Tall]]. At the end of the incident, the grieved Maekar agreed to let his youngest son, Prince [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon]] (commonly called \"Egg\") become Duncan's squire, and join him in his journeys across [[Westeros]].\n\nAt the tourney of [[Pennytree]], he defeated every opponent and crowned a [[smallfolk|commoner]] woman as the [[Queen of Love and Beauty]]. He also rescued the daughter of Lord [[Damon Lannister]] from the [[ironborn]] raiders. Duncan died, along with many others, in the [[Tragedy at Summerhall]], which was indirectly caused by Aegon in an attempt to hatch [[dragon]]s from petrified eggs.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[Old Nan]] asks [[Bran Stark|Bran]] if he wants to hear a story and proposes one about Ser Duncan the Tall, saying those were always his favorites, but Bran wants a scary story.<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\nShortly before [[Purple Wedding|his wedding]], [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] finds Ser Duncan's entry when looking through ''The Book of Brothers''.

Martin]] set roughly ninety years before the events of the main books. These stories are ''The Hedge Knight'', ''The Sworn Sword'', and ''The Mystery Knight'', the first two of which have been reprinted as graphic novels. A fourth short story, ''The She-Wolves of Winterfell'', was intended to be published in 2012, but was postponed until an unknown date.\n\nIn these stories, Duncan is revealed to be an orphan boy from the poor quarter of [[King's Landing]], the area known as [[Flea Bottom]]. He attracted the attention of a [[hedge knight]] called Ser Arlan of [[Pennytree]], and squired for the old man, accompanying him to many [[tournament]]s and on at least one major campaign, an incursion into the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]] led by [[House Dondarrion]] to root out a bandit king. Ser Arlan died on his way to a great tournament at [[Ashford]]. Taking up his sword, armor and horses, Dunk competed in the tourney as a [[Knighthood|knight]] and was joined by a young boy called \"Egg\", who asked to become his squire, though Egg was later revealed to be the young Aegon Targaryen in disguise.<ref>''The Hedge Knight''</ref>\n\nAs his nickname attests, Ser Duncan was very tall, standing nearly seven feet in height as an adult. This puts him around the same height as [[Greatjon Umber]], though not quite as tall as [[Hodor]] (who is in fact several inches ''over'' seven feet tall), but taller than [[Brienne of Tarth]] (who stands about six foot three inches).\n\nHis original name was actually \"Dunk\" - or rather, growing up as a street urchin in Flea Bottom with no knowledge of his parents or origins, that is the name he picked up as a small child and continued to use until Ser Arlan died (he doesn't remember how he got the name). When he entered himself into the tourney at Ashford as a knight, he was asked if \"Dunk\" was short for \"Duncan\", and he decided to say it was, because it was more formal and thus sounded like a better name for a knight (and for all he knew, maybe \"Dunk\" ''was'' short for \"Duncan\", given that he didn't know how he got his name).\n\nIt is strongly implied, but never outright stated, that Ser Arlan didn't actually knight Dunk before he died, but because the tourney at Ashford was strictly only letting knights enter, Dunk decided to lie and say that Ser Arlan had knighted him before his death. Any single knight can dub another man a knight, however, so for all anyone knew Ser Arlan actually did knight Dunk while they were alone on the road - squires are usually promised to eventually be knighted by the men they serve. Dunk was Ser Arlan's squire for years, and earnestly wanted to be a chivalrous knight, and Ser Arlan may have even promised to knight him at some point in the future, but then he died very suddenly from a chill while on the road to Ashford, before he got the chance. The matter is ultimately ambiguous.\n\nSomewhat like the later [[Sansa Stark]] or [[Brienne of Tarth]], Dunk became utterly enamored with Ser Arlan's teachings about the duty of a true knight to be chivalrous and defend the weak, and has a very idealized, almost ''Don Quixote'' - like belief in what knighthood is. While this strikes many experienced knights as naive, many commoners he encounters - used to being abused by greedy and selfish knights - come to admire his simple but honest belief in the vows of a knight to always do what is right and defend the innocent. During the tourney at Ashford itself, Duncan became smitten with a beautiful and tall Dornish woman named [[Tanselle]]; when she was assaulted by the sadistic Prince [[Aerion Targaryen]] (for the flippant reason that she showed a dragon dying in her puppet show, claiming it was an act of treason against [[House Targaryen]]), Duncan walked up and defended her, punching Aerion so hard he knocked loose one of his teeth. Many cynically felt that striking a prince of the royal blood like this was suicidal and utterly naive - but others, including Aerion's own uncle Prince [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor]], were moved by how Duncan lived up to a knight's vow to always protect women from harm, and how he shamed all of the other wealthier knights who were ignoring Aerion's abuse.\n\nInitially, Dunk wasn't a very exceptional fighter when he came to the tourney at Ashford. Ser Arlan had grown quite old and as they were often scrambling from one place to the next looking for work, he was rarely able to spend time giving Dunk more than basic training in the art of swordsmanship. Dunk had seen some combat with Ser Arlan, a campaign against a bandit lord in the Red Mountains. More of Arlan's teaching was in his verbal instructions about what chivalry and knightly behavior are, which he could give as they traveled. Dunk's one major advantage at the time was his great size and strength - but this was a poor match against a smaller but highly trained and skilled swordsman.\n\nThe pair of \"Dunk and Egg\" had many famous adventures. This included a visit to [[Dorne]], where they were nearly killed by the apparently insane Lady of [[Vaith]], as well as resolving a decades-long dispute between the houses Osgrey and Webber in the [[Reach]].<ref>''The Sworn Sword''</ref> They also helped foil the Second Blackfyre Rebellion<ref>''The Mystery Knight''</ref> before undertaking a lengthy journey north to visit [[Winterfell]].<ref>''The She-Wolves''</ref> Many years later Egg ascended the [[Iron Throne]] as King [[Aegon V Targaryen]]. Ser Duncan the Tall became a member of the [[Kingsguard]], and later its [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]]. Duncan was one of the heroes of the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion. Egg and Dunk faced their last adventure together at [[Summerhall]], on the night of the [[Tragedy at Summerhall|great fire]] there.<ref>''A Storm of Swords''</ref>\n\nDuncan is mentioned very rarely in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels: in ''\"A Storm of Swords\"'', when [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] sits in the Round Room and looks through [[the Book of Brothers]], he thinks about all the former Lord Commanders who ever sat in that room, among them Ser Duncan. He reads Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]'s entry, in which it is mentioned that he defeated Ser Duncan (and Prince Duncan the Small) in the winter tourney held at King's Landing.\n\nIn ''\"A Feast for Crows\"'', Brienne decides to have the shield Jaime gave her repainted, since the image it bears (a black bat, the sigil of the notorious [[House Lothston]]) makes a negative impression. Recalling an old shield she once saw in [[Selwyn Tarth|her father]]'s armory, she asks to paint her shield the same way. Strangely, the sigil Brienne describes is the one Tanselle painted for Duncan many years before; it is unknown how a shield with Duncan's original arms came to reside in the armory of [[Evenfall Hall]].\n\nHowever, while promoting ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' at Balticon in 2016, Martin confirmed a long-held fan theory that Brienne is in fact a descendant of Duncan, although the details of the lineage would eventually be revealed in the future.<ref>[https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2016/05/george-rr-martin-confirms-game-of.html George R.R. Martin confirms GAME OF THRONES/SONG OF ICE AND FIRE fan theory]</ref>\n\n==Potential adaptation==\nOn February 10, 2013, George R.R. Martin confirmed that he had been in discussion with [[HBO]] over a possible adaptation of the ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' short stories, though in what format (TV movies, theatrical movie, or a spin-off TV series) was not made clear.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/ASoWS/News/Entry/Tuf_Voyaging_Reissued_TV_Project_Discussed Westeros.org]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[de:Duncan der Gro\u00dfe]]\n[[fr:Duncan le Grand]]\n[[pl:Duncan Wysoki]]\n[[pt-br:Duncan, o Alto]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439]]\n[[zh:\u201c\u9ad8\u4e2a\u201d\u9093\u80af]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Lords Commander of the Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

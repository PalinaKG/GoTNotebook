Alongside [[Mero]], he is one of the captains of the Second Sons.\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nAlong with his co-captain Mero, and their lieutenant [[Daario Naharis]], Prendahl meets [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in her tent outside [[Yunkai]]. He rejects Daenerys's offer of breaking the Second Sons' contract with the [[Wise Masters]], and watches as Mero rudely snubs Daenerys's offers.\n\nPrendahl then discusses how to deal with Daenerys with Mero and Daario. To avoid facing her [[Unsullied]], Mero proposes that one of them slips into Daenerys's camp and assassinate her. He gives three different coins - a [[Meereen]]ese, a [[Braavos]]i, and a [[Volantis|Volantene]] - to the [[Yunkai'i whore|bedslave]] attending them and has her hand them out at random to the three of them, the one with the Braavosi coin being charged with the assassination. Daario winds up with the Braavosi coin.\n\nLater that night, after sneaking into Daenerys's pavilion, Daario presents Prendahl's head, along with that of Mero. He explains that he, Mero and Daario had \"philosophical differences\" about Daenerys's beauty and forced Daario to kill her, and he refused, and they fought him but lost. He then pledges the Second Sons to Daenerys.<ref>\"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances|8=yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPrendahl na Ghezn 3x08.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]] ''novels, Prendahl is a sellsword of [[Ghiscari]] descent and serves as the commander of the [[Stormcrows#In the books|Stormcrows]], a noted mercenary company which fights for the highest bidder.

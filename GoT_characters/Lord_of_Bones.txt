He is known for wearing a [[Giants|giant]]'s skull instead of a helmet and armor made of bones, which he wears to intimidate his enemies. His real name is unknown.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\n[[File:Rattleshirt.png|thumb|The Lord of Bones wears the front of a [[Giants|giant]]'s skull as a mask and bones as armor.]] \n[[Ygritte]] takes [[Jon Snow]] to the rest of the warparty and introduces him, to the Lord of Bones, as \"a present\". The wildling commander is dismissive of Ygritte's arguments to keep him alive, as he already has [[Qhorin]] as prisoner. He relents, however, after Ygritte's insistence and the reminder that [[Mance Rayder]] would want to decide for himself whether the [[Bastardy|bastard]] son of [[Eddard Stark]] lives or dies. However, he threatens Ygritte to castrate Jon should he try to escape. As the warband and their prisoners march to Mance Rayder's camp in [[Skirling Pass]], Qhorin attacks Jon, blaming him for the deaths of [[Stonesnake]], [[Borba]] and [[Harker]]. The Lord of Bones warns Qhorin not to strike his captive again.<ref>\"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen Halfhand attacks Jon once again, as part of his plan to have Jon infiltrate Mance Rayder's host, the Lord of Bones orders his men to let the two fight. After Jon kills Qhorin, the Lord of Bones cuts the ropes binding his hands together and orders his men to burn the Halfhand's corpse. He turns to Jon and taunts him that he would not want Qhorin's corpse [[Wight|coming back]] for him.<ref>\"[[Valar Morghulis]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nThe Lord of Bones successfully brings Jon to the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]'s camp and to Mance Rayder's tent. Removing his helmet, he is commended by Mance and then asked to leave with his group, including Ygritte, so that Mance may speak to Jon in private to which he obliges.<ref>\"[[Valar Dohaeris]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\n[[File:Lord of Bones Dead (Hardhome).PNG|thumb|The Lord of Bones beaten to death by [[Tormund]].]] \n[[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund]] visit Hardhome to rally the wildling forces to fight the undead army. The Lord of Bones meets with Tormund, and speaks about the events which led Jon and Tormund to work together. The Lord of Bones accuses Tormund of being a traitor and makes an insulting remark about Tormund sucking Jon's cock. Before he can finish the insult, Tormund grabs his staff and beats him to death with it in front of the other wildlings.\n\nIf his corpse was not burned while the parlay was taking place, it is likely that in the aftermath of the massacre at Hardhome, the Lord of Bones was reanimated as a wight by the [[Night King]] alongside all the other dead Wildlings and brothers of the Night's Watch.<ref>\"[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances||||||||yes|no|yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances|1=yes}}\n{{GoT/Season 5 appearances|8 = yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nRattleshirtPromo.png|Promotional image of Rattleshirt.\nRattleshirtWarband.png|Promotional image of Rattleshirt and his warband.\nLord_of_Bones_(Hardhome).PNG|The Lord of Bones in Hardhome.\nRattleshirt-3x01.jpg|Rattleshirt without his mask.\n</gallery>\n\n==Quotes==\n{{Quote|[[Jon Snow|He]]'s not yours to kill... [[Night's Watch|crow]]!|The Lord of Bones to [[Qhorin]]|The Prince of Winterfell}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Lord of Bones is one of a number of formerly fiercely independent wildling warrior leaders who has been recruited by [[Mance Rayder]], the King-Beyond-the-Wall, to join his forces. He is a fierce enemy of the [[Night's Watch]]. Though he refers to himself as the Lord of Bones, the Night's Watch dubbed him \"Rattleshirt\" as a mockery of the rattle sound produced by his armor. His true name is unknown.\n\nIt is not [[Tormund]] but the Lord of Bones who is captured by the Watch during the [[Battle of Castle Black]]. Tormund never goes to Hardhome and thus never kills him there, as he did in the TV show. Instead, [[Melisandre]] has him burned alive, but switches his appearance with that of Mance Rayder to make it look as if Mance is the one being burned, and Mance masquerades as the Lord of Bones for a while before revealing himself.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[de:Herr der Knochen]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041b\u043e\u0440\u0434]]\n[[fr:Seigneur des Os]]\n[[Category:Free Folk]]\n[[Category:Mance Rayder's army]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Wights]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

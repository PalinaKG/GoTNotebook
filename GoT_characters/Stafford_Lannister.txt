Stafford's army was defeated during the [[Battle of Oxcross]], and he\u00a0was killed.<ref name=\"E14\">\"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]\"</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nStafford is the brother of [[Joanna Lannister]], the late wife of [[Tywin Lannister]], which makes him the maternal uncle of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], Jaime, and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. He is also a cousin of Tywin and his brother\u00a0[[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\n[[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s army sneaks through the mountains bordering the Westerlands, and ambushes Stafford's army at night in their own camp at [[Oxcross]]. Stafford's army of raw recruits is massacred, and he\u00a0is killed.<ref name=\"E14\"/>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Lannister lesser branch family tree}}\n\n== In the books ==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Stafford Lannister is the brother of Joanna Lannister. He and his sister were the children of Lord [[Tytos Lannister]]'s younger brother. Thus, both Joanna and Stafford were first cousins of Tywin and the main branch of the family.\n\nIn his youth, Stafford and two more Lannisters were captured by Lady Tarbeck in retaliation for the imprisonment of her lord husband by Tytos. She threatened to kill the captives if her husband would be harmed. Tywin suggested his father to send Lord Tarbeck back to his wife in three pieces, but the soft-hearted Tytos complied and returned Tarbeck unharmed in exchange for the three Lannisters.\n\nStafford dies in the Battle of Oxcross, killed by Lord [[Rickard Karstark]]. Both Jaime and [[Brynden Tully]] consider him a poor commander as he didn't scout the area believing Robb was far away. Tyrion\u00a0is also very critical of Stafford for his failure and getting himself killed, calling him \"my mutton-headed uncle.\" Robb had been led by [[Grey Wind]] along a goat path and had thus bypasses fortified positions in order to attack undetected.\n\nThe Lannister survivors regrouped at [[Lannisport]] under Ser Daven Lannister, Stafford's son and widely considered to be a more intelligent commander than his father. Daven wants to avenge his father, but\u00a0Robb robs\u00a0him of his vengeance by executing Rickard Karstark.\n\nJaime reacts indifferently when Catelyn tells him about Stafford's death; he\u00a0mentions\u00a0that Cersei used to call him \"Uncle Dolt\".\n\n== See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n== References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Stafford}}\n\n[[fr:Stafford Lannister]]\n[[de:Steffert Lennister]]\n[[es:Stafford Lannister]]\n[[it:Stafford Lannister]]\n[[nl:Steffert Lannister]]\n[[pl:Stafford Lannister]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0434 \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n[[zh:\u53f2\u6234\u4f5b\u00b7\u5170\u5c3c\u65af\u7279]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

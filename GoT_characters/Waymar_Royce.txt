Of course, they will behead you as a deserter... if I don't catch you first.|Ser Waymar to [[Will]].|Winter Is Coming}}\n\nSer '''Waymar Royce''' was a sworn brother of the [[Night's Watch]] who was killed by a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nSer Waymar Royce was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Royce]], an ancient and proud noble family of the [[Vale of Arryn]], and the youngest son of Lord [[Yohn Royce]], [[Lord of Runestone|Lord]] of [[Runestone]] and the head of the family. He joined the [[Night's Watch]] and was placed amongst the [[Ranger]]s due to his noble birth and skill at arms.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Waymar_Royce,_Gared_&_Will.jpg|thumb|left|Rangers Gared, Ser Waymar Royce and Will depart Castle Black on a ranging beyond the Wall.]]\nSer Waymar Royce commands a ranging beyond the [[Wall]], accompanied by [[Gared]] and [[Will]], to investigate reports of [[wildlings]] in the [[Haunted Forest]] which lies [[beyond the Wall]]. Will, the best scout in the group, goes on a different path to scout.\n\nWhen Will rejoins Ser Waymar and Gared, he tells them about wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Gared insists on returning to [[Castle Black]] to report the situation to the [[Night's Watch]] but Ser Waymar is unfazed. Instead, he commands the group to go to the site to determine what killed the wildlings. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. Gared sends Will to find the bodies. While Will scouts around for clues, Ser Waymar is brutally slain by a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]] in front of terrified Gared.<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\n[[Sansa Stark]] mentions to Lord [[Yohn Royce]] that she had previously met him at [[Winterfell]] when Yohn was escorting his son Waymar to the [[Wall]] to join the Night's Watch.<ref>\"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Royce family tree}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Jamie_as_Waymar.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jamie Campbell Bower]] as Waymar Royce in the unaired [[Game of Thrones pilot episode|pilot episode]].]]\nIn the [[Game of Thrones pilot episode|unaired pilot episode]] he was played by [[Jamie Campbell Bower]], but was recast with [[Rob Ostlere]] when the opening scene was re-shot.\n\nHe is the first character in the series to be killed.\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Royce of [[Runestone]] is distantly related to [[House Stark]]. As is the third and youngest son of \"Bronze\" Yohn Royce, and therefore having little chance of inheriting lands or wealth, he joined the Night's Watch. Waymar was fast-tracked to being an officer because of his noble blood. Eighteen-year-old Waymar is a skilled warrior, trained by his castle's master-at-arms, but is untested in battle. He is arrogant and has a tendency to underrate the experience of other men due to their lower birth, even though they have been serving on the Wall for longer than he has, but he is not completely stupid. For example, he realized that if the Wall was \"weeping\" recently (partially melting), it could not be cold enough for eight wildlings with warm clothes, shelter, and material for a fire to simply freeze to death.\n\nThe young Sansa (who was less than 11 years old at the time) developed a massive romantic crush on the handsome young man in the brief time he and his father stayed at Winterfell before he departed to the Wall.\n\nDespite his youthful arrogance and untested nature, when the White Walkers appear he bravely attempts to fight one in single combat. However, his sword shatters after only a few clashes with the White Walker's [[White Walker ice blade|ice blade]] due to its extreme cold. One of the metal shards pierced his left eye, and he was defeated and killed. [[Will]] had been hiding in a nearby tree and witnessed the clash. After waiting for some time he hoped the White Walkers had left and climbed down: after examining Waymar's corpse, he went to retrieve his shattered sword-hilt so he could take it back to Castle Black as evidence of what happened. When Will turned to rise again, Waymar stood over him - now revived as a [[Wights|wight]], his remaining right eye glowing blue. The wight-Waymar then wrapped its hands around Will's throat and strangled him to death. The TV version changed this around so that Will, not [[Gared]], is the survivor of Waymar's party who escapes but only to be later beheaded by Ned Stark for desertion: Waymar is never shown being revived as a wight, and instead Gared is simply beheaded by another White Walker.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n{{Royce navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Royce, Waymar}}\n\n[[de:Weymar Rois]]\n[[es:Waymar Royce]]\n[[fr:Waymar Royce]]\n[[pl:Waymar Royce]]\n[[ru:\u0423\u044d\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0440 \u0420\u043e\u0439\u0441]]\n[[zh:\u5a01\u739b\u00b7\u7f57\u4f0a\u65af]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Members of House Royce]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

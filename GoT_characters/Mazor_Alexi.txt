Having gathered a large army to break the power of the Dothraki once and for all, the Sarnori met them in battle in what became known as the [[Field of Crows]]. The four Dothraki khals commanded nearly 80,000 horsemen, while the Sarnori had 100,000 foot soldiers, 10,000 armored riders, 10,000 light horsemen and 6,000 scythed chariots.\n\nThe chariots broke through the Dothraki cavalry, and the [[khalasar]] of Khal [[Haro]] fled the battle after Haro was killed. When the chariots pursued the fleeing cavalry, Alexi and his armored riders followed, the foot soldiers behind them, and the Sarnori appeared victorious. However, the Dothraki had merely set a trap, and the fleeing horsemen turned and fire a volley of arrows at the Sarnori. Two khalasars attacked their flanks while another attacked from the rear, cutting off their retreat. With no escape, Alexi and his troops were destroyed.<ref>\"[[The Dothraki]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, his story is the same.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alexi, Mazor}}\n\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Sarnori]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

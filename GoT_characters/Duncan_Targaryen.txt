He once defeated the ten-year-old [[Barristan Selmy]] in a [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Blackhaven]]. Prince Duncan took pity on the small knight and jousted against him when no one else would, giving Barristan the nickname \"the Bold\". Years later he was defeated by Ser Barristan at a winter tourney in [[King's Landing]].\n\nPrince Duncan fell in love with a woman known as [[Jenny of Oldstones]] and loved her so much he gave up his crown for her and married her against his father's wishes. Duncan's defiance caused significant trouble for his father, as the Prince of Dragonstone had been engaged to a daughter of [[Lyonel Baratheon]], the [[Lord of Storm's End]]. Although Duncan renounced his right to the throne upon his marriage to Jenny of Oldstones, Lord Baratheon was angered by this event and briefly renounced his alliegance to the Iron Throne, declaring himself [[Storm King]]. His rebellion was brief and he was defeated in a trial by battle by Ser Duncan the Tall, Duncan's namesake and the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]]. Following the end of the Baratheon rebellion, Aegon V betrothed his daughter Rhaelle to Ormund Baratheon, the heir to Storm's End. Duncan nevertheless remained a significant presence at court in the latter years of his father's reign, even being involved in the planned campaign against the Ninepenny Kings in the Stepstones (to whom he gave their name by a jape made at court).\u00a0\n\nDuncan's love for Jenny of Oldstones\u00a0inspired a song that was very popular in circles that admired \"courtly love\" and the Prince of Dragonflies and his bride remained a favorite of the smallfolk for many years.\n\nHe died in the [[Tragedy at Summerhall]], alongside his father and his namesake, before the war began in the Stepstones.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Duncan}}\n[[de:Duncan Targaryen]]\n[[es:Duncan Targaryen]]\n[[fr:Duncan Targaryen]]\n[[it:Duncan Targaryen]]\n[[nl:Duncan Targaryen]]\n[[pl:Duncan Targaryen]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u9093\u80af\u00b7\u5766\u683c\u5229\u5b89]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

And proved that where armies failed, a tongue may succeed. Wedding his strength to hers, his spear to her sun, they subdued all his rivals together. After the tradition of her people, House Martell then ruled Dorne as princes, not kings.|[[Oberyn Martell]]|House Martell (Histories & Lore)}}\n'''Mors Martell''' was the head of [[House Martell]] when the [[Rhoynar]] people, led by [[Nymeria]], landed in [[Dorne]] a thousand years ago.\n\n==Biography==\nMors Martell was one of the many nobles who vied for supremacy over the rest of the lords of Dorne. According to tradition, he fell in love with Princess [[Nymeria]], the [[Rhoynar]] warrior-queen, the first time he saw her. The two married and joined their strengths, thus allowing House Martell to defeat all rival houses and [[Nymeria's War|unify Dorne]] under their rule. In the Rhoynish fashion, House Martell adopted the title of \"Prince\" as well as equal rights of primogeniture, regardless of gender.<ref>\"[[House Martell (Histories & Lore)|House Martell]]\"</ref> After Mors was killed in battle, Nymeria took over command of his armies and ruled alone for many years.<ref>\"[[Dorne (Histories & Lore)|Dorne]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mors Martell's history is the same. In ''The World of Ice and Fire'' book it is revealed that Mors bore the title \"Lord of the Sandship\" - the seat of House Martell that would become Sunspear - and died in the Third Battle of the Boneway, slain by King Yorick V Yronwood, though Nymeria completed the conquest of Dorne, dubbed by historians as \"Nymeria's War\", and passed the crown to [[Martell (daughter of Mors)|her daughter by Mors]]. After his death, House Martell became House Nymeros Martell, \"Nymeros\" meaning \"of Nymeria\".\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martell, Mors}}\n[[de:Mors Martell]]\n[[pl:Mors Martell]]\n[[zh:\u83ab\u5c14\u65af\u00b7\u9a6c\u6cf0\u5c14]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0441 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b]]\n[[pt-br:Mors Martell]]\n[[Category:Princes of Dorne|Mors Martell]]\n[[Category:Members of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

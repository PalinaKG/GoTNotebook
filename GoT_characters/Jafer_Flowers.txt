His body was found and returned to [[Castle Black]]. \n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nJafer Flowers is a ranger in the Night's Watch. His name, Flowers, suggests that he was a [[bastard]] from the [[Reach]] before joining the Watch. He and Othor accompanied [[Benjen Stark]]'s ranging mission beyond the Wall. Both Jafar and Othor are killed while on this mission.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[Jon Snow]]'s [[direwolf]], [[Ghost]], finds Jafer's severed hand in the [[Haunted Forest]].<ref>\"[[You Win or You Die]]\"</ref> The corpses of Othor and the rest of Jafer Flowers are found [[beyond the Wall]] by [[Samwell Tarly]], Jon and a party led by [[Othell Yarwyck]]. They return the corpses to Castle Black and suggest they be burned, but [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] Jeor Mormont decides to let Maester [[Aemon]] examine them first.<ref name=\":0\">\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\nAt night, the corpses rise as [[wights]]. While Othor attacks Lord Commander Mormont, Flowers causes trouble elsewhere before being put down and burned. Both bodies are re-burned the next day, to be sure. Samwell notes that according to a book he found in Aemon's library, the touch of the [[White Walkers]] can animate the dead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jafer Flowers's background is the same as in the show.\u00a0\n\nJafer's wight attacked the main castle garrison. It killed five men, among them Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]], and continued to attack even after having its head cut off - it was only subdued after being chopped to pieces by a dozen swordsmen.\n\nUnlike in the series, when the bodies of Othor and Jafer were brought to Castle Black, both corpses had blue eyes - different from the eye color they had in their lives.\n\nJafer's severed hand, which was torn by Ghost, continued to twitch and stir long after Jafer was destroyed. [[Alliser Thorne]] took it to [[King's Landing]], but it had rotted away while he was waiting for an audience.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flowers, Jafer}}\n\n[[de:Jafer Blumen]]\n[[es:Jafer Flores]]\n[[fr:Jafer Flowers]]\n[[pl:Jafer Flowers]]\n[[nl:Jafer Bloemen]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0440 \u0424\u043b\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440\u0441]]\n[[zh:\u6770\u4f5b\u00b7\u4f5b\u82b1]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Wights]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Casualties of the conflict beyond the Wall]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Ma me nem ahakee ma Rhaego!<br>(A prince rides in me! And he shall be called Rhaego!)|[[Daenerys Targaryen]] about her unborn son.|A Golden Crown}}\n'''Rhaego''' was the son of [[Drogo]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. According to a [[Dothraki]] [[Prophecies, visions, and dreams|prophecy]], he would have been ''the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]]''. He was stillborn after being involved in a [[blood magic]] ritual.\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nDaenerys's handmaiden [[Irri]] realizes that Daenerys is pregnant with Drogo's child. They throw a small feast to celebrate. [[Jorah Mormont]] is troubled by the news and sends word of it to his paymaster, [[Varys]], in [[King's Landing]]. Daenerys tells Drogo she is certain the child will be a boy.<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref>\n\nDaenerys strikes [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] after he threatens her and her unborn son.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref> [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]] orders Daenerys, her unborn child and Viserys killed.<ref>\"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]\"</ref> In [[Vaes Dothrak]], omens are taken and the [[Dosh khaleen|crones]] proclaim that Drogo's son will be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Daenerys names him Rhaego for her deceased brother, Rhaegar.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref> Later, during a feast to celebrate, Viserys threatens to kill both Daenerys and Rhaego unless Drogo upholds his end of their bargain, to assist him in reclaiming the [[Iron Throne]]. This prompts Drogo to kill Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head. Daenerys and her unborn son are later nearly killed by an [[Wineseller|assassin]] sent by Robert Baratheon, although they are saved just in time by Ser Jorah's intervention. Upon learning of the attempt on the life of his wife and unborn son, Drogo declares to invade [[Westeros]] and take back [[Seven Kingdoms]] for Rhaego.\n\nOn the borders of [[Lhazar]], close to the [[Red Waste]], a heavily pregnant Daenerys has [[Mirri Maz Duur]] perform a blood [[magic]] ritual to save Drogo from an infected wound. Whilst the ritual is taking place, Drogo's [[bloodriders]] object to the ritual and one of them, [[Qotho]], knocks Daenerys to the ground when she tries to stop him from intervening, causing her to go into premature labor. Desperate to help her, Ser Jorah brings Daenerys into the tent where Mirri is conducting the ritual, despite her orders not to let anyone enter. Rhaego is reportedly stillborn and comes out looking like a monster. Mirri Maz Duur claims that he had scales like a lizard, was blind with bat-like wings, and had innards full of graveworms. She also says that when she touched him, his skin fell away from his bones, and that it was his death that paid for Drogo's life.<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\n\n[[File:Drogo and Rhaego 2x10.png|thumb|Khal Drogo holding Rhaego in a vision.]]\n[[File:Dany Drogo with Rhaego Valar.jpg|thumb|Daenerys's family that never was.]]\nAfter [[Pyat Pree]] tells Daenerys that her stolen [[dragon]]s are in the possession of the [[warlocks]] of [[Qarth]], in the [[House of the Undying]], she goes there to recover them. There, she sees different visions, including one of a Dothraki ''khal''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tent in a snow storm, [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the [[Wall]]. Upon entering, Daenerys finds herself back in her former home while on the [[Dothraki Sea]] in Drogo's tent. Before her are her dead husband and child, both alive again. Rhaego is seen as a small adorable boy in the arms of Drogo. Daenerys shares an emotional moment with them. Drogo says that he doesn't know if this is a dream, but if it is he will kill the man who tries to wake him. Though she longs to stay, Daenerys hears her dragons in the distance and realizes that both Rhaego and Drogo are only an illusion. She turns and walks away, and as she goes, the emotion drains from Drogo's eyes.<ref>\"[[Valar Morghulis]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|10=yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDuring the illusion scene in the House of the Undying in which Daenerys sees a vision of Rhaego had he lived, the character is actually played by a [[Wren Ros Elliot-Sloan|female infant]].\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, despite being told that her stillborn baby was a monster, Daenerys is visited by images of Rhaego as he would have been had he not been cursed by Mirri Maz Duur and survived. She sees him in her vision in the House of the Undying in Qarth. He appears to her as a young man with his father's physique and tanned skin coloring, with Daenerys's long silver-gold hair, and with almond shaped eyes of the [[Valyrian]] purple color. He stands before a burning city, under the banner of a fiery [[Horse|stallion]]. He holds out his hand to her, but then fire pours from his mouth, and he is consumed by flame.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n[[de:Rhaego]]\n[[es:Rhaego]]\n[[it:Rhaego]]\n[[nl:Rhaego Targaryen]]\n[[pl:Rhaego]]\n[[ro:Rhaego]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0435\u0439\u0433\u043e]]\n[[zh:\u96f7\u6208]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

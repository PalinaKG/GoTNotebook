Unlike the majority of Lord Walder's brood, Roslin is quite beautiful.\n\n[[Robb Stark]] undertook to marry one of Lord Frey's daughters (not specifically Roslin) as a part of the pact between him and the Freys,<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref> but he breached the agreement by marrying [[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]] instead.<ref>\"[[Valar Dohaeris]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\n[[Lothar Frey]] and [[Walder Rivers|Black Walder]] arrive at [[Riverrun]] after Robb offers to renew their alliance, but Black Walder relays that Lord Frey insists that [[Edmure Tully]] must immediately marry Roslin, having \"gone off\" long engagements after Robb reneged on his own. Edmure initially refuses (partly because he, in contrast to Robb, is not allowed to choose between Lord Frey's daughters), but eventually consents after bowing to family pressure, as well as his desire to make amends for his blunder at the [[Battle of Stone Mill]].<ref>\"[[The Climb]]\"</ref>\n[[File:Roslin frey bedded.png|thumb|Roslin is carried away at her bedding ceremony.]]\nEdmure does not meet Roslin until she is unveiled at the wedding. Having seen Walder's other daughters, Edmure was shocked and relieved to see Roslin at last. She glances at Robb, who turns to Walder, who gives him a rather sarcastic look. Roslin and Edmure get along quite well until Robb and Walder call for the [[bedding]] ceremony, when Roslin is carried off by Frey and Tully attendants to the bridal chamber.<ref>\"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]\"</ref> It is unlikely that Roslin was aware of the plans for the [[Red Wedding|grislier parts of her wedding]]. During their wedding night, Edmure impregnates Roslin, and she later gives birth to [[Tully (son of Edmure)|a son]] - although Edmure remains a captive at the [[Twins]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nDuring a conversation between [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and the captive Edmure, Jaime points out that Roslin has already given Edmure a son that was sired on their wedding night. Edmure then reveals that he hasn't seen Roslin since their wedding night and has never met his son.<ref>\"[[No One]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 3 appearances|9=yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Frey family tree}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery columns=\"3\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"170\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" position=\"center\">\n309 Roslin Frey down the aisle.jpg|Roslin is walked down the aisle to be given away by her father, [[Walder Frey]] (right).\n309 Roslin Frey wedding veil.jpg|Roslin wears a veil when she is walked down the aisle, which her father pulls back when he presents her to the groom.\nRoslin Frey s3.png\nRoslin3x09.jpg|Roslin in \"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]\".\n309 Roslin cloaked.jpg\n309 Edmure Roslin reciting wedding vows.jpg\n309 Edmure and Roslin tie the knot 1.jpg|Edmure and Roslin join hands, around which the septon begins wrapping a ribbon.\n309 Edmure and Roslin tie the knot 2.jpg|The septon \"ties the knot\" around Edmure and Roslin's hands while reciting the prayers.\nRed wedding s3 ep9.png|Roslin at the dais with her new husband, [[Edmure Tully]].\nEdmureRoslin-1-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books ==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Roslin is born from Lord Walder's sixth wife, Bethany Rosby. Roslin is the fifth child that Bethany bore Walder, and she has four older brothers: Perwyn, Benfrey, Willamen, and [[Olyvar Frey|Olyvar]]. Members of [[House Rosby]] are known to have frail health to begin with, and Bethany's frequent pregnancies took a heavy toll on her body. Walder kept Bethany almost constantly pregnant, having a new child every year of their marriage, and ultimately Roslin's mother died not long after she was born.\n\nRoslin is described as being the prettiest of [[Walder Frey]]'s offspring. She is small with very white skin, a pretty face with a small chin, delicate nose, and big brown eyes. Between her teeth she has a small gap. Her hair is brown and reaches her waist. She has a gentle nature and a talent for music. Roslin was seventeen years old in the third novel, but in the corresponding section of [[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]] in the episode \"[[The Climb]]\", she is stated to be nineteen years old: this is in keeping with how most of the younger cast members have been aged-up by two years in the TV continuity.\n\nUnlike in the TV series, Roslin is introduced to Edmure shortly after he and the Starks arrive at the Twins. Since she is so small and has narrow hips, Edmure and Catelyn are concerned about her fertility. Catelyn discusses it with Maester Brenett, and he assures her there is nothing to worry about, for Roslin's mother gave Lord Walder a child every year, five of them living past infancy.\n\nEdmure finds it strange that Roslin is sobbing when she meets him. She tells him \"I weep for joy, my lord\". Only a moment before [[Red Wedding|the massacre]] begins, Catelyn realizes the real reason for her tears: Roslin knew about the scheme and was forced to go along.\n\nBy the point the books reached, Roslin is pregnant, and has not yet given birth. According to Perwyn, Roslin has been praying that her child will be a girl, fearing (correctly) that if she gives birth to a boy, her father will have no more need of her husband.\n\nEdmure knows about his wife's pregnancy, but is unaware that if the child will be a boy, the Freys will dispose of him. Jaime promises Edmure, among his other terms of surrender, that he will send Roslin to join him in Casterly Rock; if her child is a boy, he will serve House Lannister as a page and a squire, and when he earns his knighthood, they'll bestow some lands upon him; if Roslin gives birth to a daughter, Jaime will see her well dowered when she\u2019s old enough to wed.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Roslin Frey}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Tasa|{{Frey navbox}}|{{Tully navbox}}}}\n\n[[de:Roslin Frey]]\n[[es:Roslin Frey]]\n[[fr:Roslin Tully]]\n[[pl:Roslin Frey]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0424\u0440\u0435\u0439]]\n[[ro:Roslin Frey]]\n[[zh:\u841d\u4e1d\u7433\u00b7\u4f5b\u96f7]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tully, Roslin}}\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Frey]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tully]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

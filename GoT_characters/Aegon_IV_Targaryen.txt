Aegon IV fathered several children, both trueborn and bastard. He was the father of [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys]] by his sister-wife, Queen [[Naerys Targaryen|Naerys]] and with his cousin and mistress, Queen [[Daena Targaryen|Daena]], he fathered [[Daemon I Blackfyre]].\n\nOn his deathbed, Aegon IV legitimized all his [[bastard]] children, leading Daemon Blackfyre to declare himself the rightful heir to the [[Iron Throne]] and igniting [[Blackfyre Rebellion|another war]] for the crown.<ref>\"[[The Death of Kings]]\"</ref><ref>\"[[The Bastards of Westeros]]\"</ref> Daemon's descendants in [[House Blackfyre]] would continue to revolt for almost a century afterwards, and the Blackfyre Rebellion would finally end when the rogue Targaryen cadet branch was rendered extinct in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nAegon IV (along with his vast progeny) is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.

Being attractive in his youth, he was popular with women both highborn and lowborn. He had as many as nine mistresses and many bastards. Supposedly, he had any woman he wanted, whether they were married or not. People often joked that while the Targaryen words were \"Fire and Blood,\" Aegon IV's motto might as well have been \"Wash her and bring her to my bed.\" Due to his years of overindulgence, by the end of his reign, Aegon IV was extremely obese, to the point that his legs could barely support his own weight. Even so, he remained quite vain throughout his life. Moreover, he was a very petty man, needlessly causing strife at the royal court and in his own family.\n\nFour of his bastard children were born to noblewomen, and they became known as the \"[[Great Bastards]].\" Chief among them was Daemon, who, upon being legitimized, created House Blackfyre. Other notable bastards were Aegor Rivers (\"Bittersteel\"), Brynden Rivers (\"Bloodraven\"), and Shiera Seastar. Aegon IV foolishly [[Legitimization|legitimized]] all of his bastard children upon his deathbed, which resulted in Daemon Blackfyre, rumored to be Aegon's favorite child despite being a bastard, declaring himself the rightful heir and tearing apart the Seven Kingdoms in a civil war. Ultimately, Aegon IV's corruption led to a series of [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]s, which would plague Westeros for five generations.\n\nAccording to author [[George R.R. Martin]], Aegon IV is loosely the Targaryen equivalent of King [[wikipedia:Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII of England]]. Martin's instructions for artistic depictions of Aegon IV explicitly cite Henry VIII. Both kings started out young and attractive, but by the ends of their reigns became infamously fat from overindulgence, and their numerous sexual affairs resulted in bloody succession conflicts, which were eventually resolved with the rise of good rulers (Daeron II and Elizabeth I respectively).\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{Kings of Westeros navbox}}\n\n[[de:Aegon IV.

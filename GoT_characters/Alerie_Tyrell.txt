She is the wife of [[Mace Tyrell]], the [[Lord of Highgarden]] and the head of [[House Tyrell]]. They had two children, [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] and [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]. She is the elder sister of [[Lynesse Hightower]], the estranged wife of Ser [[Jorah Mormont]].<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/tyrell/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 guide to houses, House Tyrell entry]</ref><ref name=\"House Tyrell viewers guide\">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tyrell/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Tyrell entry]</ref> Her family was murdered during the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]] and her mother-in-law [[Olenna Tyrell]] subsequently became the ''de facto'' leader of House Tyrell until Highgarden was [[Sack of Highgarden|sacked]] by [[House Lannister]] and [[House Tarly]], resulting in Olenna's death.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Tyrell family tree}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlerie's status in the TV continuity has never been established as she never appeared or was even mentioned as being alive or dead. She didn't appear at her own daughter's two weddings. The only time she was referred to (without mentioning her name) was in the episode \"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]\", when [[Sansa Stark]] discussed her upcoming marriage to [[Tyrion Lannister]] with Margaery; Margaery tried to console Sansa as best she could, by pointing out that Tyrion isn't the worst Lannister and would possibly be able to make her happy, even in a sexual way. In a naive manner, Sansa asked Margaery if her mother taught her insight in those matters, with Margaery's only reaction a smirking acknowledgement. Even the Tyrell actors said it was never clearly established what the status of Alerie was. The writers may have kept it deliberately vague to keep their options open as the story progressed. With the declaration in Season 7 that with the death of Olenna, House Tyrell is extinct, it seems most likely that Alerie simply died some years before the TV series even began.\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Alerie's family remains the same, except she and Mace have two other sons, named Willas and Garlan. She is described as tall and dignified and has long silver hair (presumably from age and not Valyrian heritage). She is younger than her husband. At a function, she refers to Olenna as \"mother\", but Olenna snaps that she would have remembered giving birth to Alerie, and that she is \"only to blame\" for Alerie's husband.\n\nIn the third and fourth novels, Alerie is actually present in King's Landing with most of the other Tyrells. She attends the [[Purple Wedding]], and comforts Margaery when her new husband has been poisoned. She remains through Tywin's funeral and Tommen's wedding, and later leaves King's Landing with Olenna and Garlan, thus she is not involved in the following events at the capital.\n\nAlerie's father is Lord Leyton Hightower. The identity of her mother is unclear: Leyton's fourth and current wife is Rhea Florent, but Alerie's mother might have been one of his previous wives. [[Gerold Hightower]], [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]], was Leyton's uncle - thus, through Alerie, the famed Ser Loras Tyrell is in fact the grandson of Gerold's nephew.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF|Alerie Hightower}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hightower navbox}}\n{{Tyrell navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tyrell, Alerie}}\n\n[[de:Alerie Tyrell]]\n[[es:Alerie Hightower]]\n[[pl:Alerie Hightower]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043b]]\n[[zh:\u827e\u52d2\u8389\u00b7\u6d77\u5854\u5c14]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tyrell]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hightower]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

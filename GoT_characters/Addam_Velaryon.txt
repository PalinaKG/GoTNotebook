Luckily for her, over the centuries House Targaryen had spilled more than blood on Dragonstone. She promised gold and title to any of the Targaryen bastards who could tame the six untamed dragons on the island. These bastards were called the dragonseeds, though most were called supper. Perhaps the dragons were eventually sated or bored, but four of them accepted riders and were enlisted in Rhaenyra's cause.|[[Viserys Targaryen]]|The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)}}\nSer '''Addam Velaryon''' was a [[dragonrider]] for [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s [[Blacks|faction]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nAddam was a [[Bastardy|bastard]] scion of [[House Targaryen]] - known as one of the \"dragonseeds\". Originally he lived in obscurity on the ancestral Targaryen holding, [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone island]]. As the great Targaryen civil war known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]] progressed, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s faction - which was based on Dragonstone - realized that they had more living dragons than dragon-riders, with six riderless beasts nesting on the island. It is believed that only those of Targaryen blood can successfully bond with and ride a dragon, so Rhaenyra proclaimed rewards for any commoners on Dragonstone who could successfully bond with one of the unclaimed dragons - specifically Targaryen bastards and descendants of Targaryen bastards who had been fathered over the years on commoners of the island by young Targaryen princes. Addam was one of only four of the so-called dragonseeds to successfully bond with a dragon, [[Seasmoke]].<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==In the books==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Addam Velaryon, previously known as Addam of Hull, was a [[Legitimization|legitimized]] [[bastard]] of [[Dragonseeds|dragonseed]] descent. His origins are disputed, with his mother Marilda claiming that he and his brother Alyn were fathered by Ser Laenor Velaryon, which is considered unlikely since Laenor was homosexual. The court [[fool]] Mushroom claimed that their father was Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] and was unacknowledged so as not to offend Corlys's wife [[Rhaenys Velaryon|Rhaenys Targaryen]].\n\nPrince [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] sought more dragonriders to fight for the [[Blacks]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]], with many men on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] answering the call. Addam bonded with [[Seasmoke]] while Alyn tamed [[Sheepstealer]], through the [[dragon]] set fire to his cloak and Addam had to use his own cloak to extinguish it. Lord Corlys soon petitioned Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] to legitimize the brothers, to which she agreed, naming Addam as Addam Velaryon and making him the heir to [[Driftmark]].\n\nAddam aided Rhaenyra in the [[Fall of King's Landing]], circling the city to show that any who attempted to defy their new rulers would be met with fire. He remained in the city with Rhaenyra and her son [[Joffrey Velaryon]], with Seasmoke, [[Syrax]] and [[Tyraxes]] defending the capital.\n\nOnce [[Ulf the White]] and [[Hugh Hammer]] betrayed the Blacks at the First Battle of Tumbleton, many on the [[Black Council]] questioned Addam's loyalty. Only Lord Corlys spoke in his defence, but Rhaenyra was suspicious and ordered that Addam be arrested in the [[Dragonpit]]. Corlys warned Addam and he fled on Seasmoke, with Corlys being beaten, imprisoned and dismissed as Hand of the Queen as punishment. Determined to prove his loyalty to the Blacks, Addam flew to the [[Gods Eye]], landed on the [[Isle of Faces]] and took counsel with the Green Men. He then flew to the castles of lords who supported Rhaenyra, marshaling an army of four thousand men and marching on [[Tumbleton]].\n\nAddam and his army [[Sack of Tumbleton|attacked]] Tumbleton at night, catching the [[Greens]] off-guard. He rode Seasmoke and attacked the enemy dragons [[Vermithor]], [[Silverwing]] and Tessarion, and the battle ended in victory for the Blacks, though Addam and the four dragons were killed.\n\nIn 138 AC, Addam's bones were returned to Driftmark from [[Raventree Hall]], with his brother Alyn putting only the world \"LOYAL\" as the epitaph on his tomb.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velaryon, Addam}}\n\n[[ru:\u0410\u0434\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d]]\n[[Category:Bastards]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Blacks]]\n[[Category:Dragonseeds]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Dragonriders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

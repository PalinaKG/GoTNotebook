Just like most of the other members of the Kingsguard at the time, he too was fiercely loyal to his oaths, fighting for the crown during [[Robert's Rebellion]].\n\nHe was present at the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bells]] to rally the remaining royal forces and later on lead the army of the royalists to the [[Battle of the Trident]], alongside Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], Prince [[Lewyn Martell]] and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. He died at the Trident fighting until the end for his cause.\n\nAlthough [[Jaime Lannister]] remembers him as a earnest and honorable man, he (like most of his sworn brothers) did nothing against the atrocities committed by the Mad King, not even intervening when the King raped Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]]. He stated that they were sworn to protect the royal family, except from the King.\n\nHe was the brother of Ser [[Willem Darry]], another Targaryen loyalist, who would later on smuggle the surviving [[Viserys Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[Daenerys Targaryen|children]] away to the [[Free Cities]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MadKingKingsguard}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darry, Jonothor}}\n[[de:Jonothor Darry]]\n[[es:Jonothor Darry]]\n[[fr:Jonothor Darry]]\n[[it:Jonothor Darry]]\n[[nl:Jon Darring]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0414\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0438]]\n[[zh:\u743c\u6069\u00b7\u6234\u745e]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:House Darry]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard of Aerys II Targaryen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

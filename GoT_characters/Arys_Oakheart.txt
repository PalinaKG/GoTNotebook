He is a member of House Oakheart, a noble house from the Reach.\n\nHe is regarded as one of the kinder knights of the Kingsguard under King Joffrey, objecting at first to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s orders to beat [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], then only hitting her as lightly as he can. He is also of a much more pleasant demeanor, often engaging in pleasant conversation with the Stark girl.\n\nArys remains in Dorne as Myrcella's sworn shield. During this time, Arianne Martell, Prince Doran's daughter and heiress, sexually seduces him. She persuades him to take part in her plan to crown Myrcella to incite war with the Iron Throne in retaliation for the death of [[Oberyn Martell]]. The plan is foiled, as Arianne's party is intercepted by Areo Hotah. Ser Arys, bravely but foolishly, charges at the surrounding soldiers and kills some of them, but is killed by Hotah. During the confrontation, Myrcella is gravely injured and nearly killed by one of their escorts, Ser Gerold \"Darkstar\" Dayne.\n\nCersei is pleased to hear about Ser Arys's death since it creates a vacancy on the Kingsguard - which is filled by her new champion, Ser [[Gregor Clegane#In the books|Robert Strong]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Kingsguard navbox}}\n{{King's Landing Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oakheart, Arys}}\n[[de:Arys Eichenherz]]\n[[es:Arys Oakheart]]\n[[pl:Arys Oakheart]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041e\u043a\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u4e9a\u5386\u65af\u00b7\u5965\u514b\u8d6b\u7279]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Oakheart]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Jaehaerys was wise and diplomatic, and desired harmony between the Crown and the Faith for the good of the realm, so he negotiated a peaceful end to the [[Faith Militant uprising]]. Jaehaerys, together with his new [[Hand of the King]], Septon Barth, reached an accord with the [[High Septon]]: the crown would grant an amnesty and swear to always defend the Faith, and in return, the [[Faith Militant]] would disband and the Faith would withhold condemnations of the [[Incest|incestuous]] practices of the Targaryens.<ref>\"[[The Faith Militant]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Barth is remembered as one of the best Hands of the King that the realm ever had, just as Jaehaerys I is remembered as possibly its best king. Together they did much to improve and strengthen the realm across four decades of peace and prosperity.\n\nBarth was low-born, the son of a blacksmith. He eventually became a [[Septon|septon]] and served in a humble position overseeing the [[Red Keep]]'s library, where he became one of the most learned men in Westeros. King Jaehaerys I raised him up to be his Hand of the King; Jaehaerys greatly loved his sister-wife Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]], who was practically his co-ruler, but it is said that Barth was his greatest friend, who was also very skilled in his office, aiding Jaehaerys in all the great works of his reign. While Barth was very well-educated, he remained plain-spoken and approachable.\n\nBarth greatly valued all knowledge and even took an interest in rare manuscripts from across the [[Narrow Sea]] which had survived the [[Doom of Valyria]]. From his translated readings he wrote several famous compendiums of his own on topics such as [[magic]] and [[dragon]]s, leading some later writers to criticize that he was half a sorcerer (though of course, given that during Jaehaerys's reign ''living'' dragons were kept at the royal court, it wasn't that far-fetch for Barth to study them).\n\nBarth's writings include several claims which later maesters dismiss as mere fantasy (i.e. believing that the [[White Walkers]] actually existed once), particularly in his book ''Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History'' - considered one of the best recent works on dragon-lore. However, about sixty years after Jaehaerys's death the pious King [[Baelor I Targaryen]] ordered all of Barth's books hunted down and burned for containing wicked and unnatural knowledge.\n\nA few precious fragments of Barth's writings survived Baelor's destruction order and they are of great value to those interested in topics such as dragons. [[Tyrion Lannister]] managed to gets his hands on a fragment about ten years before the main narrative. Maester [[Aemon]] was also well-versed in readings from the surviving fragments, knowledge he shared with [[Samwell Tarly]]. Aemon said that according to Barth, dragons can actually shift gender from female to male and back again, as the needs of the species require - other maesters are aware of this claim but dismiss it as fantastical.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[pl:Barth]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0442]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]\n[[Category:Septons]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Torrhen amassed his army and marched to meet the [[Targaryen]] warlord but by the time he arrived, Aegon had already won the decisive [[Field of Fire]] and conquered most of the South of Westeros. After seeing Aegon's dragons and his massive host, Torrhen realized the war was already lost.[[File:Torrhen_kneels.jpg|thumb|King Torrhen Stark submits to Aegon the Conqueror.]]\nInstead of fighting, he chose to [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] and surrendered his crown in order to spare his people. For his submission, Aegon named him Lord Paramount and Warden of the North. Though some Northerners sneer at Torrhen as \"the king who knelt\", his descendants [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Sansa Stark]] argue that Torrhen \"saved thousands of lives that day\" and that his critics forget they are alive today because of him.<ref>\"[[House Stark (Complete Guide to Westeros)|House Stark]]\"</ref><ref>\"[[Northern Allegiances to House Stark]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nWhen [[Jon Snow]] appears before [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] on [[Dragonstone]], the latter scoffs when [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] presents Jon as the [[King in the North]].

Many northern bannermen wanted to attack anyway, claiming northern valor would carry the day. Others wanted to fall back to [[Moat Cailin]] and make a stand there. But Torrhen had heard how the armies of the Rock and the Reach had burned on the Field of Fire and had seen the fires still glowing beneath the rubble of Harrenhal. He knelt and laid his ancient crown as Aegon's feet and rose as a king no more but Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. Some Northerners still sneer at my ancestor as \"The King who Knelt\", forgetting that because of Torrhen they're alive today to sneer. Their ancestors didn't leave their burned bones at the Trident and their twisted swords didn't fill Aegon's new [[Iron Throne|throne]].|[[Sansa Stark]]| Northern Allegiances to House Stark}}\n\n==In the books==\n[[File:The_King_who_Knelt.png|thumb|Torrhen bends the knee to Aegon and his sisters, foreverafter becoming known as the King Who Knelt.]]\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Torrhen Stark's story is the same. It is believed he knelt at the place where the Inn of the Kneeling Man sits at the time of the books.\n\nTorrhen's army numbered about 30,000 men, but the Targaryen army that came to meet him numbered about 45,000 - nor did this represent all of Aegon's new bannermen, just the ones directly facing him. Moreover, the Targaryens had their three huge dragons. Torrhen's bastard brother, [[Brandon Snow]], volunteered to sneak into the Targaryen camp at night and attempt to kill ''all three'' dragons while they slept, but Torrhen judged that this was impossible and that the failed attempt would only invite further retaliation from the Targaryens, so he chose to surrender instead. As a result, neither Torrhen's sword nor the sword of any Northern lord was incorporated into the [[Iron Throne]], as Aegon used only the swords of those he conquered, not those who capitulated.\n\nTorrhen Stark's decision to kneel before Aegon Targaryen saved the North from the devastation inflicted upon the Gardeners and the Lannisters. The Conqueror not only confirmed the Starks as the rulers of the North, but he also allowed them to keep their own customs: the Targaryens' laws would rule over the North, but they could keep their local custom of personally beheading condemned men instead of delegating the task to an executioner. Queen [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]], as part of her efforts to keep the realm together after the Conquest, organized a marriage between Lord Stark's daughter and Lord Arryn. However, although Torrhen had bent the knee, his sons did not want to serve the Targaryens. It was only over their strong protests that the marriage took place, and they refused to attend the marriage. The North remained in the realm, so it can be assumed that Torrhen was able to prevent his sons from rising up against the Targaryens. It is unknown if Torrhen was still alive when Aegon visited Winterfell in 33 AC, during his last royal progress.\n\nIn \"''A Storm of Swords''\", after the Starks suffer a series of losses and the situation seems hopeless, Catelyn suggests Robb to surrender to the Lannisters. She reminds him that Torrhen\u00a0Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires. Robb answers angrily \"Did Aegon kill King Torrhen's father? Never, I said\".\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n{{Seven Kingdoms Kings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stark, Torrhen}}\n\n[[fr:Torrhen Stark]]\n[[de:Torrhen Stark]]\n[[pl:Torrhen Stark]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a]]\n[[Category:Kings in the North]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Wardens]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of Winterfell]]\n[[Category:Members of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Argilac the Arrogant, the last of the Storm Kings, foolishly left the safety of his stronghold, and met the Baratheon warlord in open battle. Argilac was soundly defeated, and Orys took his lands, his holdings and his daughter. Orys was said to be a half-brother to Aegon Targaryen. If this were true a little \"blood of the dragon\" mingled with that of the stag in those days.|[[Robert Baratheon]] on his ancestor|House Baratheon (Complete Guide to Westeros)}}\nLord '''Orys Baratheon''' was the founder of [[House Baratheon]], and was the bastard half-brother of [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon I Targaryen]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nOrys Baratheon is the founder of [[House Baratheon]] and is the distant ancestor of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his brothers, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]].\n\nDuring the [[War of Conquest]], he was a commander in the army of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], and was the Conqueror's [[bastard]] half-brother. When Aegon invaded [[Westeros]], he sent Orys to seize [[Storm's End]], the ancestral seat of the [[Storm Kings]] and capital of the [[Stormlands]]. Orys defeated the Storm King, [[Argilac the Arrogant]], and [[Last Storm|took]] not only Storm's End but also his sigil (the crowned black stag) and words (\"Ours is the Fury\"), as well as his daughter [[Argella Baratheon|Argella]], and his sword, Torment, to cement his rule over the Stormlands. He became the first [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]].<ref>\"The Complete Guide to Westeros: House Baratheon\" featurette, Season 1 Blu Ray boxset</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:House Baratheon lineage.jpg|thumb|left|The lineage of Orys Baratheon]]He has an entry in ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.

He served Aegon as the first-ever [[Hand of the King]], as well as the commander of his forces. Aegon offered Orys's hand in marriage to the daughter of the Storm King, Argilac Durrandon, but was rebuffed. Angered at the insult of being offered a bastard instead of a king, Argilac cut off the hands of Aegon's envoys.\n\nWhen Aegon landed his army at the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]], he led a lightning campaign to secure the surrounding area, taking [[Rosby]], Stokeworth, [[Duskendale]] and [[Maidenpool]] in short order. Orys led the army while Aegon attacked from the skies.\n\nAfter this victory, Aegon sent Orys and his sister-wife [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] to take Storm's End. Argilac left his castle to give battle in the open, attacking during a torrential thunderstorm to limit the use of Rhaenys's dragon, [[Meraxes]]. However, Meraxes instead fought on foot and was still able to inflict carnage on Argilac's forces. Argilac himself was slain by Orys. Orys negotiated the surrender of Storm's End, with Argilac's daughter Argella delivered to him in chains and naked. Orys treated her kindly and later wed her.\n\nOrys continued to serve Aegon as\u00a0Hand of the King until the [[First Dornish War]], during which his hand was cut off by the Wyl of Wyl while in captivity. Orys would afterwards be known as Orys ''One-Hand'' and ''the King's Stump'', and after his return to the [[Red Keep|Aegonfort]], resign as Hand of the King due to a sense of lost pride. He was later replaced in the office by a succession of men, including Lord Edmyn Tully, Lord Alton Celtigar, Ser Osmund Strong, and Lord Alyn Stokeworth. Nevertheless, he remained an important figure at the Conqueror's court, standing by Queen Visenya when Princess Deria presented Aegon I with Dorne's terms to end the war between their two realms. Orys outlived the Conqueror and served\u00a0Aenys I, who succeeded Aegon I upon his death. Orys later died during one of the numerous local rebellions against Aenys I: many lords hoped that with Aegon the Conqueror dead and his weak son on the throne, they might be able to throw off Targaryen rule forever. These rebellions were crushed by Aegon's ruthless younger son, [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], who succeeded Orys as Hand of the King.<ref>[http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/83614-bubonicon-45/page__st__40 Bubonicaon 45 GRRM live-read]</ref>\n\nArchmaester Gyldayn believes Orys to be Aegon's bastard brother with a certainty; in ''Fire & Blood'', Gyldayn writes about Orys and Aegon's brotherhood as fact, and even claims that Orys's grandson Rogar boasted that he was the blood of the dragon.<ref>''Fire & Blood'' by [[George R.R. Martin]]</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Aegon the Conqueror and Orys Baratheon may be loosely inspired by that of the real-world William the Conqueror of Normandy and Odo of Bayeux, who was the Norman conqueror's half-brother (Orys was rumored to be Aegon's half-brother) and vassal, and upon the conquest of England, was made the ruling earl of an important region of England and was his brother's regent and chancellor in that country.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Orys}}\n\n[[fr:Orys Baratheon]]\n[[de:Orys Baratheon]]\n[[es:Orys Baratheon]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u5965\u91cc\u65af\u00b7\u62dc\u62c9\u5e2d\u6069]]\n[[Category:Legitimized bastards]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Lords of Storm's End|Orys]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Small council]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

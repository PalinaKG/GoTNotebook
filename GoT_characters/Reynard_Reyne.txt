He was killed during the [[Reyne Rebellion]] by Ser [[Tywin Lannister]] along with the rest of his house.\n\n==Biography==\nWith their sister [[Ellyn Reyne]] unwelcome at [[Casterly Rock]] due to her attempted affair with [[Lord of Casterly Rock|Lord]] [[Tytos Lannister]], Reynard and his brother [[Roger Reyne]] met with the lord to asked him for extravagant loans. Lady Ellyn then used the gold they had been granted to restore [[Tarbeck Hall]] to its former splendor. [[Lordship|Lord]] Tytos approached them for repayment and they laughed at him, with Tytos soon laughing along with them.\n\nFollowing his return from the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], Tytos's son [[Tywin Lannister]] was determined to re-establish [[House Lannister]] as the dominant house in the [[Westerlands]] and demanded that all debts owed to them be paid immediately or a [[hostage]] from those who could not. Reynard merely laughed when he received the [[raven]].\n\nTywin later marched on [[Tarbeck Hall]] and [[Castamere]] with an army behind him. Upon seeing them approach Tarbeck Hall, Ellyn sent [[raven]]s to her brothers at Castamere. Roger's army reached Tarbeck Hall just in time to see it consumed by flames. He charged Tywin's camp, hoping the element of surprise would overcome Tywin's greater numbers. Half of Roger's men were killed and he received a crossbow bolt to the back before he fled back to Castamere. Tywin's host arrived three days later and the Reyne brothers retreated into the underground mines and offered terms to him to avoid a long siege. Tywin gave no reply and ordered the mines to be sealed with stone and soil to prevent them from escaping. He then had the stream beside the castle dammed and directed to the main entrance, drowning the brothers. Their deaths inspired the song ''[[The Rains of Castamere]]''.<ref>\"[[The Rains of Castamere (Histories & Lore)|The Rains of Castamere]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Ser Reynard Reyne was a charming and cunning man who was less headstrong than his brother [[Roger Reyne]]. The brothers were often present at [[Casterly Rock]] during their sister [[Ellyn Reyne]]'s [[marriage]] to [[Tion Lannister]]. They returned to [[Castamere]] following Tion's death as his younger brother [[Tytos Lannister]] was groomed for leadership by their father Lord [[Gerold Lannister]]. Ellyn later wed [[Walderan Tarbeck]], [[Lord of Tarbeck Hall]].\n\nIt has been claimed that in 255 AC [[House Tarbeck]] angered King [[Aegon V Targaryen]] with their territorial demands. Lord Tytos sent Lord Denys Marbrand to capture them, but he and his men were killed when they were ambushed by a force led by Roger. Reynard convinced Tytos that Roger had mistaken the men for outlaws and Tytos pardoned both the Reynes and Tarbecks.\n\n[[Tywin Lannister]] returned from the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]] and attempted to restore order to the [[Westerlands]]. Roger oversaw the safe exchange of [[hostage]]s held by [[House Lannister]] and [[House Tarbeck]] at Castamere.\n\nDuring the [[Reyne Rebellion]], Tywin killed Lord Walderan in the field and [[Fall of Tarbeck Hall|destroyed]] [[Tarbeck Hall]]. [[House Reyne]]'s army attacked Tywin's, but were overpowered by their greater numbers. Reynard took charge of the army once Roger had become feverish after a crossbow wound and was incapable of leading.\n\nReynard led the Reyne force back to Castamere and had them retreat into the underground mines. It has been said that he offered peace terms to Tywin if Tywin's brothers were sent into Castamere as hostages. Tywin refused the offer and ordered his men to barricade Castamere's entrances with stone. He then had them redirect a nearby stream into the castle, flooding it and drowning the remaining members of House Reyne.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Reynard Regn]]\n[[es:Reynard Reyne]]\n[[fr:Reynard Reyne]]\n[[it:Reynard Reyne]]\n[[nl:Reynaart Reyn]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0420\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u96f7\u7eb3\u591a\u00b7\u96f7\u8036\u65af]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reyne, Reynard}}\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Reyne]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

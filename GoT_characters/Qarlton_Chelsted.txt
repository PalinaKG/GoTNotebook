He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him.|[[Jaime Lannister]] describing the death of Qarlton Chelsted.|Kissed by Fire}}\n'''Qarlton Chelsted''' was the [[Hand of the King]] late in the reign of [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Aerys II Targaryen]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nLord Qarlton briefly served as Hand of the King during [[Robert's Rebellion]], but was [[Execution|executed]] with [[wildfire]] for disobeying King Aerys.<ref>\"[[Mad King Aerys]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\nWhile in the baths of [[Harrenhal]] with [[Brienne of Tarth]], [[Jaime Lannister]] recalls Aerys's fondness for wildfire and his execution of [[Lordship|lords]] and hands with the substance, including Lord Qarlton.<ref>\"[[Kissed by Fire]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jaime Lannister recalls Qarlton Chelsted as a craven man up until his defiance of King Aerys. He was nicknamed the \"mace-and-dagger Hand\" because of his sigil.\n\nAccording to ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Lord Qarlton served as Master of Coin late in the reign of Aerys II Targaryen and was a strong supporter of the king over his son, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. When the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]] took place, it was believed that Rhaegar was secretly funding it as a means to call a Great Council and depose his father, and Qarlton unsuccessfully tried to convince Aerys to forbid the tourney. He later accompanied Aerys to Harrenhal and after Rhaegar won the final joust, Qarlton and Lord Symond Staunton brought the king's suspicions to a boil by claiming that Rhaegar had participated to endear the smallfolk and present himself to the lords as the true heir to Aegon the Conqueror. Rhaegar's crowning of [[Lyanna Stark]] as the queen of love and beauty was seen by Qarlton as further proof of the prince's betrayal.\n\nAfter [[Jon Connington]] lost the [[Battle of the Bells]] during Robert's Rebellion, he was dismissed as Hand and exiled. Qarlton succeeded him as Hand, and soon noticed the comings and goings of members of the [[Alchemists' Guild]]. He eventually discovered that Aerys [[Wildfire plot|plotted]] to burn [[King's Landing]] to the ground with wildfire in the event of a rebel victory; he pleaded with the king to abandon this plan. When Aerys refused, Qarlton resigned as Hand, only to be dipped in wildfire and burned alive as punishment (Jaime privately admits that, having always dismissed Chelsted as a sycophant, he admired the man for finding the courage to defy Aerys). He was succeeded as Hand by the king's pyromancer, [[Rossart]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Chelsted, Qarlton}}\n\n[[de:Qarlton Chelsted]]\n[[es:Qarlton Chelsted]]\n[[it:Qarlton Chelsted]]\n[[nl:Carlton Chelstede]]\n[[zh:\u79d1\u5c14\u987f\u00b7\u5207\u65af\u5fb7]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0442\u043e\u043d \u0427\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0434]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Masters of Coin]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:House Chelsted]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Targaryen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

His son, Ormund Baratheon, was first introduced in the book series with ''The World of Ice and Fire'' in 2014. The Season 1 prop establishes Lyonel Baratheon as the husband of Rhaelle Targaryen and father of Steffon Baratheon, but subsequent [[Histories & Lore]] featurettes established Ormund as Steffon's father. With the effective retcon of Steffon's father, it is unclear if Rhaelle Targaryen married Ormund as in the book series (as she is listed in the prop as Steffon's father) or Lyonel (her husband per the prop). Lyonel has birth and death dates in the prop; 204 and 249 AC, respectively, but these have to be considered retconned as Steffon's birth year per the prop, 229 AC, becomes impossible if he were to be the grandson of a man born in 204 AC.\n\n==In the books==\nLyonel Baratheon appears in ''The Hedge Knight'', one of the stories in the ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' series, which focuses on Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon V Targaryen during Aegon's time as Ser Duncan's squire. Ser Lyonel is known as \"the Laughing Storm\". He would often break into booming laughter the moment tourney rivals touched his shield, and laugh all the time he was mounting and charging and knocking them from their stirrups. If his challengers wore any sort of crest on their helm, Ser Lyonel would strike it off and fling it into the crowd.\n\nLyonel participated in the tourney at [[Ashford]] Meadow, challenging Ser Robert Ashford in the first tilt. Breaking nine lances, both lost their saddles on the tenth course and fought onwards on foot, sword against mace. The battered Robert eventually admitted defeat, and Lyonel became champion. Before fighting for Ser Duncan the Tall, he knighted Raymun Fossoway.\n\nBecause Lyonel was a faithful supporter of Aegon V as the Lord of Storm's End, Aegon was pleased to arrange the betrothal of his eldest son and heir, Prince [[Duncan Targaryen|Duncan]], to Lyonel's daughter. However, Prince Duncan broke the betrothal when he fell in love with and married the commoner [[Jenny of Oldstones]]. The outraged Lyonel felt that the honor of House Baratheon had been insulted, and rose in rebellion against the [[Iron Throne]], declaring himself [[Storm King]]. A short rebellion followed, but this was ended when Ser Duncan the Tall, now [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], defeated Lyonel in a trial by combat. Prince Duncan renounced his claim to the throne, and Aegon agreed to betroth his youngest daughter, Princess Rhaelle, to Lyonel's heir, [[Ormund Baratheon]]. Rhaelle was sent to Storm's End to serve as Lyonel's cupbearer and companion to his wife. In the TV series continuity, Rhaelle married Lyonel rather than Ormund and her relation to Aegon V is not clear.\n\nThe entry for Lyonel in the ''Lineages'' book from Season 1 ([[:File:Steffon.jpg|see this image]]) says that he died at the age of 45, but this is unlikely to be true in the book continuity, and possibly a case of the TV writers just filling in the gaps of knowledge for the prop book. In the novels, he apparently died between 239 AC and 245 AC, and when he took part in Duncan's trial by seven in 209 AC he was already a large and powerful warrior. Assuming that Lyonel was at the very least 16 years old in 209 AC (like Duncan was, though he was probably older), he would have been born around 193 AC. Lyonel therefore could have been at most around 52 years old when he died - but from how he is presented in ''The Hedge Knight'', he was ''apparently'' somewhat older than Duncan. More information may be filled in with future ''Tales of Dunk & Egg'' novellas.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Lyonel}}\n\n[[ru:\u041b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u83b1\u6602\u8bfa\u00b7\u62dc\u62c9\u5e2d\u6069]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of Storm's End]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

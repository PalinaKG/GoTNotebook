His mother was the first child and daughter of [[Viserys I Targaryen]], who did not change the succession of the [[Iron Throne]] upon the birth of his sons. This therefore made Joffrey fourth in line for the throne. When his grandfather died, his uncle was named [[Aegon II Targaryen]], on the orders of his step-grandmother [[Alicent Hightower]]. When Rhaenyra heard the news, the [[Dance of the Dragons]] began. By this time, Laenor had presumably died and Jacaerys' mother had remarried her uncle [[Daemon Targaryen]], and had [[Aegon III Targaryen|two]] [[Viserys II Targaryen|sons]] with him. By the time his mother sat on the Iron Throne, his [[Jacaerys Velaryon|older]] [[Lucerys Velaryon|brothers]] had both died at the hands of the [[Greens]], and she was not popular among the [[Smallfolk]], who started to rebel against her. A certain follower of the faith, the [[Shepherd]], declared that the [[dragon]]s were demons and claimed that that they ruled this world. Pointing to the [[Dragonpit]], he signaled to [[Storming of the Dragonpit|attack it]] and kill the dragons. This ended with the death of all four dragons in the pit, including the destruction of it. Joffrey, who watched the violence from the [[Red Keep]], mounted his mother's dragon, [[Syrax]], still thinking that he could save the dragons. However, Syrax did not understand Joffrey's intentions, and in stead of flying to the ruins of the Dragonpit, he moved erratically to be free of him, until he was. Joffrey fell from him, to his death. Mourning for her son, Rhaenyra decided to sail back to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], Joffrey's death signaling that Rhaenyra would never succeed as being a peaceful Queen.<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==Family tree==\n===Paternal===\n{{HotD/House Velaryon family tree}}\n\n===Maternal===\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n== In the books ==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n| Spoiler =\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Joffrey Velaryon was the third son of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and her first husband, Lord Laenor Velaryon. He was named after his father's favorite [[Knighthood|knight]] and companion, Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. Joffrey was a dragonsider who mounted the [[dragon]] [[Tyraxes]]. He was a strapping lad with brown hair and eyes and a pug nose. His physical features caused many to suspect that Ser Harwyn Strong was his true father.\n\nWhen he was three years old, his ten-year-old half-uncle Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] slapped him in an attempt to claim the dragon [[Vhagar]] for himself. Joffrey called for his two older brothers, [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon]], and in the ensuing fight Aemond lost an eye.\n\nJoffrey was twelve when the [[Dance of the Dragons]] began and was betrothed to a daughter of Lord Desmond Manderly in exchange for [[White Harbor]]'s support of the [[Blacks]]. He was ordered to [[Gulltown]] do defend the [[Vale of Arryn]] from King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]'s dragons, with [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aegon III)|Rhaena Targaryen]] choosing to accompany him. [[Grand Maester]] [[Munkun]] claimed that Jacaerys wanted to keep his brother far away from the fighting, and Joffrey was named [[Prince of Dragonstone]] after Jacaerys' death at the [[Battle of the Gullet]].\n\nDuring the [[Storming of the Dragonpit]], Joffrey mounted his mother's dragon [[Syrax]] in an attempt to save the dragons, but Syrax threw her unfamiliar rider to his death.\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Velaryon navbox}}\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velaryon, Joffrey}}\n[[de:Gottfrid Velaryon]]\n[[es:Joffrey Velaryon]]\n[[nl:Joffry Velaryon]]\n[[pl:Joffrey Velaryon]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0444\u0444\u0440\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:J\u4e54\u4f5b\u91cc\u00b7\u74e6\u5217\u5229\u5b89]]\n[[Category:Blacks]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Velaryon|Joffrey]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

His mother was the first child and daughter of [[Viserys I Targaryen]], who did not change the succession of the Iron Throne upon the birth of his sons. This therefore made Lucerys third in line for the throne. When his grandfather died, his uncle was named [[Aegon II Targaryen]], on the orders of his step-grandmother [[Alicent Hightower]]. When Rhaenyra heard the news, the [[Dance of the Dragons]] began. By this time, Laenor had presumably died and Lucerys's mother had remarried her uncle [[Daemon Targaryen]], and had two more sons with him. In order to gain more supporters on the mainland of [[Westeros]], Rhaenyra sent him on his [[dragon]], [[Arrax]], to [[Storm's End]]. However, by the time he arrived, his uncle [[Aemond Targaryen]] was already there, pledging Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] to pledge himself to the [[Greens]]. However, Lucerys still pleaded his mother's case, but Borros had made his decision. He sent him back to Dragonstone, saying that his bitch of a mother cannot summon him like a dog. Aemond then looked insistingly at Lucerys, his sapphire eye gleaming. This cause him to run out of the castle in a fright. However, he was caught in the middle of a storm whilst leaving, which made is difficult for him to fly very far. Lightning and thunder delayed him. Just then, he heard [[Vhagar]]'s roar, as he soared throught the clouds with Aemond on his back. Vhagar was five times the size of Arrax. As all of [[Storm's End]] watched, Vhagar bit into Arrax neck, eventually decapitating it. With Arrax's lifeless body falling, Lucerys fell into [[Shipbreaker Bay]], only to be consumed by the waves. His mother considered ending the [[Dance of the Dragons]] when she heard about this, but his stepfather/great-uncle Daemon had other ideas.<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==Family tree==\n===Paternal===\n{{HotD/House Velaryon family tree}}\n===Maternal===\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n| Spoiler =\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lucerys Velaryon was the second son of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and her first husband Ser Laenor Velaryon. He was a dragorider who mounted the [[dragon]] [[Arrax]]. He was a strong strapping lad with brown hair and eyes and a pug nose and was skilled at arms. His physical features caused many to suspect that Ser Harwyn Strong was his true father.\n\nLucerys gained the favor of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] when he was presented at court. In 118 AC Rhaenyra announced that Lucerys and his older brother [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] would [[Marriage|marry]] [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aegon III)|Rhaena]] and Baela Targaryen, the daughters of Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] and Laena Velaryon.\n\nPrince [[Aemond Targaryen]] attempted to ride the dragon [[Vhagar]] and was confronted by the Velaryon brothers, during which he broke the five-year-old Lucerys' nose and Lucerys took Aemond's eye out with his dagger in retaliation.\n\nLord [[Corlys Velaryon]] fell ill and Rhaenyra urged him to name Lucerys as the heir to [[Driftmark]], since Jacaerys was in the line of succession for the [[Iron Throne]].\n\nLucerys was fourteen at the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], having long served as a [[squire]] beforehand. He was sent on a mission to [[Storm's End]] to urge Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] to fight for the [[Blacks]], swearing on to his mother the [[The Seven-Pointed Star]] before his departure that he would to no part in the fighting. When he arrived he found Prince Aemond already there with Vhagar, but ignored him and delivered his letter to Lord Borros. Borros asked Lucerys which of his four daughters he would like to wed, but he pointed out that he was already betrothed to his cousin Rhaena. Borros ordered him to leave and Aemond drew his sword as he approached Lucerys, who insisted that he had merely come as a messenger.\n\nHe departed on Arrax as a storm raged around them. As they struggled to stay airborne, they were pursued by Aemond on Vhagar. The two dragons met over [[Shipbreaker Bay]] and Arrax was slaughtered by the much larger and more experienced Vhagar. Both dragon and rider plummeted to their deaths in the raging waters below, with Lucerys' body and Arrax's head and neck washing up on the shores beneath Storm's End three days later.\n\nRhaenyra collapsed on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] when she learned of her son's death and Joffrey swore to take vengeance on Aemond and Borros. To avenge Lucerys' death, Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] hired [[Blood]] and [[Cheese]] to murder one of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]'s sons. Alicent Hightower and her father Ser Otto were said to have been horrified by Aemond's murder of Lucerys, since they knew killing one of her sons would only intensify Rhaenyra's furious desire to claim the throne.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Velaryon navbox}}\n}}\n[[de:Lucerys Velaryon]]\n[[es:Lucerys Velaryon]]\n[[it:Lucerys Velaryon]]\n[[nl:Lucerys Velaryon]]\n[[pl:Lucerys Velaryon]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u044e\u0446\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u8def\u65af\u91cc\u65af\u00b7\u74e6\u5217\u5229\u5b89(\u96f7\u59ae\u62c9\u4e4b\u5b50)]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velaryon, Lucerys}}\n[[Category:Blacks]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Velaryon|Lucerys]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Dragonriders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

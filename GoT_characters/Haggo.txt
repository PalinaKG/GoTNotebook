He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the [[arakh]]. Unlike [[Cohollo]] and [[Qotho]], Haggo wears a leather vest as protection.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\nHaggo, alongside [[Qotho]] and [[Cohollo]], accompanies Khal [[Drogo]] to view his bride, [[Daenerys Targaryen]].<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\nHaggo is present at the feast in which a drunken [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] threatens Daenerys and her [[Rhaego|unborn child]]. He doesn't take part when Drogo orders Qotho and Cohollo to restrain him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Raiding|raid]] of a [[Lhazareen]] village in [[Lhazar]], [[Mago]]\u00a0defies Drogo. Haggo, along with his fellow [[bloodrider]]s, steps forward to defend\u00a0Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters in his own hands.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\nDrogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from [[Red|his horse]] in front of the khalasar, a sign of great weakness. While Daenerys and then Cohollo kneel to the sides of the khal to check on him, Haggo remains mounted alongside [[Qotho]].<ref>\"[[Baelor]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes|||||yes||yes|yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Haggo is another of Drogo's bloodriders. During the wedding of Daenerys and Drogo, Haggo gives them a large leather whip with a silver handle. When the three bloodriders attempt to stop the [[Mirri Maz Duur]]'s [[blood magic]] ritual to heal Drogo, Haggo is killed by [[Rakharo]] and Jhogo.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[fr:Haggo]]\n[[es:Haggo]]\n[[it:Haggo]]\n[[zh:\u54c8\u6208]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0430\u0433\u0433\u043e]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Bloodriders]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Halt!|Todder as [[Jon Snow]] returns to [[Castle Black]].|Mhysa}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTodder was first mentioned in Season 1's \"You Win or You Die\", but he didn't appear on-screen until Season 3's \"Mhysa\". Even then, the actor wasn't identified by name to be playing Todder until Season 5's \"Hardhome\".\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Todder is the son of a winesink owner. He is described as a short, ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. He has pig eyes, small and shiny. Instead of a Builder, Toad is made a [[Ranger]]. He's part of the group of friends that prevent Jon Snow from abandoning the Night's Watch when the latter flees to join [[Robb Stark]] on his march south to wage war against the [[Iron Throne]].\n\nOn \"A Dance with Dragons\", Toad complains about Melisandre's preaching, that she calls the Seven and the old gods false gods, and made the wildlings burn weirwood branches. Later, Jon sends him to serve at the Shadow Tower.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n[[ru:\u0422\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440]]\n[[zh:\u9676\u5fb7]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

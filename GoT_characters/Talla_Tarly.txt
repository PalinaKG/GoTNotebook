She is the sister of Samwell and Dickon.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 6|Season 6]]===\nTalla's brother Sam is en route to the [[Citadel]] to study about the [[White Walkers]]. Since the Citadel does not accept women and children, he plans to send [[Gilly]] and her baby [[Sam]] to live with his family at Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father Randyll, he gets on with Talla and their mother Melessa.<ref>\"[[Oathbreaker]]\"</ref>\n\nTalla eagerly greets Sam as he arrives with Gilly and her baby, complaining about her arranged marriage to the old, yellow-toothed [[Symun Fossoway]]. Talla takes Gilly under her wing and starts musing on what color she would look best in. She also offers to put Gilly up in one of her bedrooms.\n[[File:Blood of my blood House Tarly dinner.jpg|thumb|Talla and her family have dinner with Gilly.]]\nAt dinner, Talla makes small talk with Gilly, and is impressed that Gilly can hunt for herself, as Randyll never saw the need for her to learn. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a wildling, Melessa listens to his rant before giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow.<ref>\"[[Blood of My Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n=== [[Game of Thrones Season 7|Season 7]] ===\nWith the deaths of her father and Dickon in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Goldroad]],<ref>\"[[Eastwatch]]\"</ref> and with Sam unable to inherit as both a man of the [[Night's Watch]] and a [[Order of Maesters|maester]]-in-training, Talla becomes the Lady of Horn Hill and head of House Tarly.\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 6 appearances|6 = yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n===Paternal===\n{{House Tarly family tree}}\n===Maternal===\n{{House Florent family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Talla has been briefly mentioned as Sam's sister but otherwise not described in detail and has not yet appeared. She has not been betrothed to anyone.\n\nRandyll Tarly has five children: his eldest child Samwell, then three daughters, and finally his second son Dickon. After he became dissatisfied with the bookish Samwell as a child, he kept having more children with his wife, until they produced another son to replace him. Talla is the eldest of Samwell's three sisters (the other two haven't been named). \n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Tarly navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarly, Talla}}\n\n[[de:Talla Tarly]]\n[[es:Talla Tarly]]\n[[fr:Talla Tarly]]\n[[nl:Talla Tarling]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0438]]\n[[zh:\u5854\u62c9\u00b7\u5854\u5229]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Members of House Tarly]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Lords of Horn Hill]]\n[[Category:Ruling ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

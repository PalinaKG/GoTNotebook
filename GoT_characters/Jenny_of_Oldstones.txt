Since Bran claimed to have seen this through [[warg]]ing, [[Archmaester (Eastwatch)|one of them]] compared this to Jenny's claim that she was descended from the [[Children of the Forest]].<ref>\"[[Eastwatch]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nShortly before the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]], [[Podrick Payne]] sings ''[[Jenny of Oldstones (song)|Jenny of Oldstones]]'', a song composed in her honor.<ref>\"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jenny of Oldstones was a poor woman who won the heart of Prince [[Duncan Targaryen]] and married him against the wishes of his father, King [[Aegon V Targaryen]], due to the fact that he was already betrothed to the daughter of Lord [[Lyonel Baratheon]]. Aegon attempted to have the marriage undone, but Duncan refused to leave Jenny and gave up his right to the throne.\n\nLyonel was so enraged at the offense, however, of the Targaryens breaking the promised marriage betrothal, that the Stormlands rose up in a brief but bloody rebellion, culminating in an epic [[trial by combat]] between Lord Lyonel and his old friend Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], now Aegon V's [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]].\n\nShe was the inspiration for many songs, which famously remember her \"with flowers in her hair\". Jenny was a very popular romantic figure in later songs for many a young maiden (like [[Sansa Stark]]): Jenny, the commoner girl for whom the heir to the Iron Throne gave up his inheritance out of love.\n\nWhen Prince Duncan met her, Jenny was a mysterious girl who lived half-wild in the ruins of Oldstones, which had once been the ruling castle for a dynasty of the [[First Men]] who were wiped out thousands of years before in the [[Andal Invasion]]. She claimed that she descended from those ancient kings of the First Men - though people from the surrounding villages mocked that she had no way of knowing that even if it was true. Jenny did not claim to be descended from the [[Children of the Forest]], but a [[woods witch]] with whom she was friends with did make this claim about herself. This friend made a [[Prophecies, visions, and dreams|prophecy]] in which she claimed that [[the Prince That Was Promised]] would be born of the line of Prince [[Aerys II Targaryen]] and [[Rhaella Targaryen]], which caused King Jaehaerys II Targaryen to arrange the marriage between his children.\n\nJenny was eventually accepted at court, even called \"Lady Jenny\" out of respect, and was beloved of the smallfolk throughout the realm. Prince Duncan later died in the great fire known as the [[Tragedy at Summerhall]], but it is unrecorded exactly what happened to Jenny, or whether she survived or not.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[de:Jenne von Altsteinen]]\n[[es:Jenny]]\n[[nl:Jenny van Oudestenen]]\n[[it:Jenny di Vecchie Pietre]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0439]]\n[[zh:\u8352\u77f3\u57ce\u7684\u7b80\u59ae]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

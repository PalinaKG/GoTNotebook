When Oberyn was sixteen, he was found abed with Lord Edgar's mistress. Edgar challenged the prince to a duel, though only to first blood due to Oberyn's youth and high birth. Both men took cuts and honor was satisfied. However, while Oberyn soon recovered, Edgar's wounds festered and he died. Afterward it was rumored that Oberyn had poisoned his sword, gaining his nickname of \"The Red Viper\".<ref>\"[[Poisons]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Edgar Yronwood's backstory is much the same. In the TV continuity, however, it is implied that Oberyn slept with both Edgar's wife and\u00a0his paramour.\n\nEdgar's death might have resulted in a blood feud and a rebellion, but [[Doran Martell]] acted quickly to prevent that:\u00a0Oberyn went to [[Oldtown]], and from there across the [[Narrow Sea]] to [[Lys]], though none dared call it exile.\u00a0In due time, Doran's second son Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.\u00a0Those steps helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yronwood, Edgar}}\n\n[[fr:Edgar Ferboys]]\n[[pl:Edgar Yronwood]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0434\u0433\u0430\u0440 \u0410\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0443\u0434]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Members of House Yronwood]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Martell]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

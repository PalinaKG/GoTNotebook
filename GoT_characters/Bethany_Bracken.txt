How did he die? Defending Aegon the Unworthy from the brothers of a man whom Aegon fed to his dogs. The man's crime? Sleeping with one of the many mistresses Aegon wasn't using. And the man was one of Aegon's own Kingsguard.|Bronn|The Kingsguard}}\n'''Bethany Bracken''' was a member of [[House Bracken]] who lived during the reign of [[Aegon IV Targaryen]].\n\n==Biography==\nBethany Bracken was a mistress of King Aegon IV, the Unworthy. She was caught abed with Ser [[Terrence Toyne]], a [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Kingsguard]]. King Aegon had Ser Terrence fed to his dogs.<ref>\"[[The Kingsguard]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bethany is indirectly referred to. Her identity was revealed by GRRM in an interview, which established her as Aegon IV's seventh mistress, and her backstory expaned in ''The World of Ice and Fire''. Bethany Bracken was groomed from childhood by her father, who had been Aegon's [[Hand of the King]], and her older sister, Barbra Bracken, to seduce King Aegon and replace Melissa Blackwood, who had in turn replaced Barbra as Aegon's mistress, thus restoring the king's favor upon House Bracken.\n\nBethany caught Aegon's eye, as his father and sister intended, when he visited [[Stone Hedge]] to visit [[Aegor Rivers]], one of his [[bastard]] sons, and took her with him to [[King's Landing]]. However, Bethany found his \"royal embraces\" distressing, and turned to Ser Terrence Toynce for comfort and the two became lovers. They were caught abed by Aegon himself, resulting in the death by torture of Ser Terrence and the execution of Bethany and her father.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Bracken navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bracken, Bethany}}\n\n[[ru:\u0411\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Bracken]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Exactly how it sounds: seven men against seven men. |[[Bronn]]|Justice of the Seven Kingdoms}}Ser '''Willem Wylde''' was a member of [[House Wylde]].\n\n==Biography==\nWillem Wylde fought in the [[Trial by seven of Duncan the Tall]].<ref>\"[[Justice of the Seven Kingdoms]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Willem Wylde was a member of the [[Kingsguard]] during the reign of [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Daeron II Targaryen]]. When a place opened in the Kingsguard, Daeron gave the position to Ser Willem. Daeron either did not know or willfully ignored his father [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]]'s promise to Ser Quentyn Ball that he would be raised to the Kingsguard. This was one of the contributing factors to Ser Quentyn siding with [[Daemon I Blackfyre]] during the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].\n\nSer Willem, along with his two fellow Kingsguard members Ser Roland Crakehall and Ser Donnel of [[Duskendale]], escorted the royal [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[Prince|princes]] to [[Ashford]] for the [[Tournament|tourney]]. After Prince [[Aerion Targaryen]] invoked the Trial of Seven all three Kingsguard members present were made part of his seven. Ser Willem was carried off the field unconscious at the end of the trial.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Wylde navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wylde, Willem}}\n[[ru:\u0423\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0423\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0434]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:House Wylde]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

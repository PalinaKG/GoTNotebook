When mother dies my sister gets the castle because she's older.|[[Lollys Stokeworth]] to [[Bronn]]|The House of Black and White}}\n\n'''Falyse Stokeworth''' is the eldest daughter of [[House Stokeworth]] and heir to [[Castle Stokeworth]].\n\n\"Falyse\" is pronounced \"Fuh-lease\".\n\n==Biography==\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 4|Season 4]]===\n\nFalyse crops up in a conversation between [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Bronn]], when the latter visits Tyrion in his cell while awaiting his [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial]]. Bronn reveals that [[Cersei Lannister]] has arranged a marriage between him and Falyse's younger sister [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]] in a successful effort to sway the ambitious ex-sellsword\u00a0from Tyrion's\u00a0service. Tyrion\u00a0points out that Falyse, not Lollys, is\u00a0the heir to\u00a0[[House Stokeworth]]\u00a0and their castle.\u00a0Bronn has apparently already considered this, and remarks that Falyse\u00a0is\u00a0barren and should she perish before her father,\u00a0Lollys\u00a0would become the heir.<ref>\"[[Mockingbird]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 5|Season 5]]===\n[[Lollys Stokeworth]] and her newly betrothed Ser [[Bronn]] of the Blackwater walk on the grounds outside the castle, as Lollys talks excitedly about plans for their upcoming wedding. Bronn muses that he never thought he'd end up settling down in a fine a place as this. Confused, Lollys corrects him that after her mother ([[Tanda Stokeworth]]) dies, the castle will pass to her sister, because she is older than Lollys. She also says that her sister hates her, calls her names, and even still she pulls Lollys's hair when she thinks their mother isn't looking. Bronn assures Lollys that her sister is mean, and mean people always end up getting what's coming to them - clearly still holding to his plan to surreptitiously kill off Falyse after he marries Lollys.\n\nThey then see that [[Jaime Lannister]] has arrived at the castle. He privately informs Bronn that he needs him to accompany a secret mission he is taking to [[Dorne]]. To encourage Bronn to go, the Lannisters have now promised Lollys to [[Wyllis Bracken]]: Jaime vaguely promises that they will find Bronn a better bride with an even bigger castle, though Bronn is not amused.<ref>\"[[The House of Black and White]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Stokeworth family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Falyse is known to have an acid tongue. She is described as looking like a fish and drinking like one too, being quite fond of hippocras. She has been married to Ser Balman Byrch for ten years, but they remain childless. It is rumored that he shuns her bed.\n\nThere is no mention in the novels that Falyse hates Lollys and used to bully her.\n\nShe attends the [[tournament]] on King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s [[nameday]] with her mother Lady Tanda and her sister Lollys. She arrives in [[King's Landing]] with a small troop of soldiers the day before the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. During the battle she stays with her sister and mother in [[Maegor's Holdfast]].\n\nAfter marrying Falyse's sister Lollys, Bronn moves to Castle Stokeworth. Very soon,\u00a0Falyse and her husband grow\u00a0to loathe him; they consider him\u00a0insolent, uncouth, foul-mouthed, and not a true knight (a very accurate description of Bronn).\n\nIn the wake of [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|Tywin's death]] and Tyrion's escape, Cersei, driven by paranoid delusions, believes that despite buying him off with the marriage to Lollys, [[Bronn]] remains loyal to Tyrion, and persuades Falyse and her husband to kill him. Cersei had hoped they would arrange a 'hunting accident' in the same way she arranged [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert's death]], but instead Balman challenges Bronn to single combat, arrogantly (and foolishly) believing that as a knight, he can get the better of the former sellsword. Unfortunately, Balman and Falyse severely underestimate Bronn; with his usual pragmatism, Bronn kills Balman's horse in their duel, causing the dying animal to crush Balman's legs beneath it when it falls. Bronn then kills Balman, after torturing a confession out of him that Cersei was behind the attempt on his life.\u00a0Bronn strikes Falyse, threatening\u00a0to kill her as well after letting the castle garrison gang-rape her,\u00a0if she is not gone from Castle Stokeworth by morning. When Falyse orders Bronn seized, the castle guards reveal they are loyal to Bronn, bluntly advising her to \"do as Lord Stokeworth says\".\n\nFalyse returns to King's Landing to beg Cersei for soldiers to retake her castle, but a furious Cersei refuses, berating Falyse and her husband for failing their task so spectacularly. Worried her position will be undermined if word of her involvement in the attempted assassination gets out, Cersei hands Falyse over to [[Qyburn]], who uses her in his experiments. By the time\u00a0Cersei contemplates sending Falyse back to Stokeworth to reclaim it from Bronn, it is too late: Qyburn informs her that Falyse is still alive, but barely; she cannot even\u00a0feed herself, much less rule.\n\nIn the appendix of the fifth novel, it is mentioned that Falyse\u00a0died screaming in the black cells.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stokeworth navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stokeworth, Falyse}}\n[[de:Falyse Schurwerth]]\n[[ru:\u0424\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0442]]\n[[fr:Falyse Castelfoyer]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Stokeworth]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

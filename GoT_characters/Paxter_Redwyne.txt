Lord Varys already knows and lists the illicit practices his spies have uncovered including Lord Redwyne's sexual proclivity towards prepubescent boys.<ref>\"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no mention is made of Lord Paxter's sexual preferences \u2013 if this was indeed the \"Lord Redwyne\" that\u00a0Varys was referring to, and not some distant cousin.\n\nLord Paxter Redwyne commands one of the largest fleets in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] which anchors at the [[Arbor]]. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], he participated in the [[Siege of Storm's End]]; his fleet prevented the castle from being resupplied by sea. It is mentioned in passing that [[Stannis Baratheon]] still bears a grudge against Lord Redwyne for this.\n\nHe is the first cousin and oldest friend of his liege lord, [[Mace Tyrell]]. He married Mace's elder sister, Lady Mina of House Tyrell, and they have two sons, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, and\u00a0one daughter, Desmera.\n\nLord Redwyne is described as \"stoop-shouldered and thin, his bald head fringed by tufts of orange hair.\"\n\nLord Redwyne doesn't side with Renly in the [[War of the Five Kings]], as Cersei held his twin sons hostage at the Red Keep. Following the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], he is made an advisor on the Small Council, alongside his liege Mace Tyrell and another of the Tyrells' bannermen, Lord Mathis Rowan. At the breakfast prior to Joffrey's wedding ceremony, he unveils a scale model of a war galley with 200 oars being built in the shipyards of the Arbor, which will be named ''King Joffrey's Valor'', though it's currently unknown if the name was changed following Joffrey's death.\n\nIn the fourth novel, Cersei sends\u00a02,000 Lannister soldiers and the Redwyne fleet, under the command of Lord\u00a0Redwyne, to conquer [[Dragonstone]]. Lord Redwyne, a veteran military commander, decides against launching an open assault, since it may result in unnecessary casualties; instead, he chooses a slower but safer tactic - laying a siege to the castle, in order to starve the besieged into submission (what may take at least six months). He also orders to dig a tunnel underneath the castle walls. Some time later,\u00a0[[Loras Tyrell]] takes the command over the besieging troops and manages to take the castle quickly, but at great and unnecessary cost.\n\nFollowing the taking of Dragonstone, Cersei orders Lord Redwyne to sail the Redwyne fleet back to the Reach, to deal with the ironborn raiders who conquered the [[Shield Islands]].\n\nIn the fifth novel, following Cersei's arrest, Lord Redwyne is given a seat at the Small Council\u00a0as the\u00a0Master of Ships\u00a0and Grand Admiral.\n\nCurrently, Lord Redwyne on is his way to the [[Arbor]] to fight [[Euron Greyjoy]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Redwyne navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Redwyne, Paxter}}\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0420\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d]]\n[[it:Paxter Redwyne]]\n[[pl:Paxter Redwyne]]\n[[zh:\u6d3e\u514b\u65af\u7279\u00b7\u96f7\u5fb7\u6e29]]\n[[Category:Members of House Redwyne]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Tyrell]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

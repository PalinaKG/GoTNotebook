The council discussing how to deal with the coming threat of the [[White Walkers]], and how to deal with the fallout of the defeat of the Boltons. Sansa suggests giving [[Karhold]] to one of the Northern lords who had been a proven ally of the Starks, but Jon dismisses this idea, as Alys wasn't to blame for her father's actions. The argument of what to do with the surviving Karstark and [[House Umber|Umber]] children goes back and forth.\n[[File:701 Alys and Ned.png|thumb|left|At Winterfell, Alys Karstark and [[Ned Umber]] renew their Houses' vows of fealty to the Starks.]]\nUltimately, Jon calls Alys and [[Ned Umber]] forward. They are visibly afraid that Jon will announce that he will execute them. Instead, Jon holds to his original position that he will not hold them responsible for the crimes of their fathers, and orders them to swear fealty to the Starks once again. Relieved, without hesitation Alys and Ned ceremonially kneel, draw their swords, and swear to serve Jon and the Starks.

She is described as tall and skinny, with brown hair and a long face (somewhat similar to [[Arya Stark|Arya]]). As the Karstarks are a [[cadet branch]] of House Stark (that split off a thousand years ago) she is also a distant kinsman of the main Stark line - so her resemblance to Arya isn't coincidental. She is the sister of Torrhen, Harrion, and Eddard Karstark (renamed \"Harald\" in the television series). In the books, Alys is actually two years older than Sansa, and around one year younger than Robb and Jon.\n\nAlys is a headstrong girl who knew Robb and Jon during childhood. Her father hoped to have her betrothed to Robb to strengthen ties with the Starks, though nothing came of it. She danced with both of them at feasts, finding Robb courteous but Jon somewhat sullen. Jon vaguely remembers that, since Alys was six years old at the time (and Jon was around seven or eight years old).\n\nShe is later betrothed to Daryn Hornwood, heir of [[House Hornwood]], until he is killed by [[Jaime Lannister]]\u00a0in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]];\u00a0two of Alys's brothers, Eddard and Torrhen, are killed in the same\u00a0battle, also\u00a0by Jaime. After Jaime is released by [[Catelyn Stark]], Rickard promises\u00a0Alys's hand to whoever brings\u00a0the Kingslayer to him, in order to avenge the deaths of his sons.\n\nAlys's surviving brother Harrion is taken captive at the Battle of Duskendale (due to Roose Bolton's treachery). He is imprisoned in [[Maidenpool]], but it has been almost a year since his surviving kin received news about it, and it is uncertain if he is still alive.\n\nFollowing Rickard's death, his treacherous uncle Arnolf, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons, schemes to take over Karhold: he announces in public that he supports Stannis (intending to stab him in the back while fighting the Boltons), hoping that the Lannisters will execute Harrion as a punishment, then Alys will become the heiress of Karhold. Arnolf plans to force Alys to marry his son Cregan (though he is her first cousin once removed, this is not considered [[incest]] in [[Westeros]]). They also plan to dispose of her as soon as she gives birth to a son by Cregan, who has already buried two wives.\n\nAlys finds out about Arnolf's twofold treachery and\u00a0escapes to [[Castle Black]]; she wisely stays away from the Kingsroad\u00a0and villages, riding\u00a0along the bed of little streams, to throw hunters off her trail. Upon her arrival, she\u00a0informs Jon what her great-uncle is up to. She has no idea what became of her brother Harrion as a result of Arnolf's fake announcement.\n\nAlys resents Robb for killing her father. Though she knows for what crime her father was executed, it does not make a difference for her, but since Jon belongs to the Night's Watch, there is no blood feud between them, and she asks his help to save both her and Stannis from Arnolf. Jon quickly sends Tycho Nestoris to find Stannis and to warn\u00a0him of the traitor in his host, and he does. Arnolf, his son Arthor and grandsons are arrested, and Stannis intends to execute them: if they admit their guilt - they will be given the same swift death Robb gave Rickard; if not - they will be burned alive.\n\nThe [[Battle of Winterfell (War of the Five Kings)|Battle of Winterfell]] has not come yet to a conclusion by the point the novels reached (it has not even begun), but thanks to Alys the Boltons have been denied of one of the advantages they had over Stannis.\n\nMeanwhile, to keep the Boltons and Arnolf from forcing Alys into a marriage to seize her birthright, Jon quickly arranges for Alys to marry Sigorn, the son of [[Styr]] and the new Magnar of the Thenns who has become one of his allies, to found House Thenn. Alys complies voluntarily, and when Cregan arrives to reclaim Alys, Jon has him arrested and placed in an ice cell.\n\nSome time before Alys arrives at Castle Black, [[Melisandre]] sees her in a flame vision. Thinking incorrectly that the \"girl in grey on a dying horse\" is Arya Stark, she tells that to Jon. Unfortunately, Melisandre's mistake makes Jon ignore her warning about \"daggers in the dark\", which [[Mutiny at Castle Black|turns out to be correct]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\u00a0\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Karstark navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karstark, Alys}}\n[[ru:\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0441 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a]]\n[[de:Alys Karstark]]\n[[fr:Alys Karstark]]\n[[es:Alys Karstark (serie)]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Karstark]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Lords of Karhold]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Ruling ladies]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

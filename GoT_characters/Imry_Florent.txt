However, due to his sister Selyse's marriage to Stannis, the Florents declare for Stannis in the [[War of the Five Kings]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nDuring the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Ser Imry accompanies Stannis aboard the King's flagship, the ''[[Fury]]''. After much of Stannis's fleet is destroyed with [[wildfire]], Stannis orders his forces to disembark. Ser Imry warns Stannis that hundreds will die trying to reach the shore. The King replies that it will actually be thousands, but is the first to climb down to a ferry boat.<ref>\"[[Blackwater]]\"</ref>\n\nAs the King's flagship was not engulfed in wildfire during the battle, his fate and whereabouts are unknown.\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|9=yes}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{House Florent family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Imry Florent, like the rest of House Florent, declares for Stannis after the death of [[Renly Baratheon]].\n\nAt the Battle of the Blackwater, Ser Imry is given command of Stannis's fleet as Lord High Captain and leads it blindly into [[Blackwater Rush]], instead of sending scouts as [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] advises him. He is killed in the battle when the flagship ''Fury'' is engulfed in wildfire.\n\nStannis is not saddened over Ser Imry's death. He regards Ser Imry as \"that fool of Florent who sailed my fleet into the jaws of a trap\".\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Florent navbox}}\n{{Dragonstone Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Florent, Imry}}\n\n[[de:Imry Florent]]\n[[pl:Imry Florent]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u043c\u0440\u0438 \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442]]\n[[zh:\u4f0a\u59c6\u745e\u00b7\u4f5b\u7f57\u4f26]]\n[[Category:Knights|Florent, Imry]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Florent]]\n[[Category:Bannermen of House Baratheon of Dragonstone]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

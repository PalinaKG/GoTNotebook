He is long accustomed to treating Doran's gout, and designed the wheelchair that he uses.\n\nHis appearance in the show partly resembles his description in the books, having a shaven head, smooth cheeks, and wearing dun colored robes. Unlike in the show, he is fat, has soft pink hands and is no more than five feet tall.\n\nMaester Caleotte serves also as Doran's advisor. After hearing [[Obara Sand|Obara]]'s plan of revenge, Caleotte suggests it may not be prudent to allow Obara to return to Sunspear, because she is certain to inflame the [[Smallfolk|common people]]. Doran agrees with the maester and returns to Sunspear, where he orders to arrest the [[Sand Snakes]], to prevent them from stirring troubles.\n\nMaester Caleotte takes precautions to protect his prince: after Doran caresses Tyene's head, Caleotte examines his palm, looking for scratches that may indicate poisoning.\n\nFollowing the near-fatal attempt on Myrcella by [[Knighthood|Ser]] Gerold \"Darkstar\" [[House Dayne|Dayne]], Maester Caleotte saves her life but cannot heal her disfigured face.\n\nMaester Caleotte is present when Ser [[Balon Swann]] presents the skull of [[Gregor Clegane]] to Doran, Ellaria, and the Sand Snakes.\n\nSo far in the books, he is alive.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Martell navbox}}\n[[de:Caleotte]]\n[[es:Caleotte]]\n[[nl:Caleotte]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043e\u0442\u0442]]\n[[fr:Caleotte]]\n[[Category:Maesters]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Martell]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

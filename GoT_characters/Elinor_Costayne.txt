Desperate to cement his stolen throne with an heir, Maegor took three wives at once, known as the Black Brides because each were women he'd widowed in his wars. All three women grew full with child in time, but each gave birth to the same twisted monstrosities as his second wife. One need not be a maester, much less a Grand Maester, to deduce the common thread here. |[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel}}\nQueen '''Elinor Costayne''' was a member of [[House Costayne]] and wife of [[Maegor Targaryen]], one of the three \"[[Black Brides]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nKing Maegor married Elinor out of desperation for an heir, after failing to produce one with his first three wives, choosing her because she was of proven fertility. Her late husband was at some point killed by Maegor. However, she still miscarried just like the others.<ref>\"[[Maegor the Cruel]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Elinor Costayne's husband Theo Bolling was executed, accused of conspiring with Queen Alyssa Velaryon to place Prince [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] on the [[Iron Throne]]. After seven days of mourning, she was forced to marry King Maegor.\n\nAfter King Maegor's death, Elinor became a [[septa]] and Mother of the Great Motherhouse of [[Lannisport]].\n\nElinor was one of the Seven Speakers who were assigned by Jaehaerys to spread rumors all over the realm about his wife [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]]'s virtues, thus make the people accept their incestuous marriage.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Costayne, Elinor}}\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

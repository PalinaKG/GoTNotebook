Alysanne rode the dragon [[Silverwing]], and her husband Jaehaerys rode the dragon [[Vermithor]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:HL5 List of dragons manuscript.png|thumb|Alysanne's name appears on-screen in a list of dragons and dragon riders from an in-universe manuscript.]]\nAlysanne was the sister-wife of Jaehaerys I, the fourth king of the Targaryen dynasty. Like Jaehaerys, she was a child of the second Targaryen king, [[Aenys Targaryen]]. Their uncle [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] seized the [[Iron Throne]] upon their father's death, during the [[Faith Militant uprising]].\n\nAfter Maegor eventually died, Jaehaerys ascended to the throne, with Alysanne as his queen. Jaehaerys and Alysanne ruled so long that upon Jaehaerys's death, he was succeeded by their grandson, [[Viserys I Targaryen]].\n\nQueen Alysanne was a [[dragonrider]]. Her mount was [[Silverwing]], one of the large second-generation progeny of the original three Targaryen dragons.<ref>\"[[The Faith Militant]]\"</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n===Ancestors===\n{{House Targaryen family tree Conquest era}}\n\n===Descendants===\n{{HotD/House Targaryen family tree}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jaehaerys I is fondly remembered as one of the best kings the Targaryen dynasty ever produced, and his sister-wife Alysanne is similarly remembered as one of its best queens. Indeed, Alysanne was practically a co-ruler with Jaehaerys, heavily involved in governing the realm - and given that they were both children of the past king and married to each other, it was somewhat of a moot point exactly which one of them was the \"official\" monarch (technically Jaehaerys was).\n\nJaehaerys I and Alysanne were the youngest children of Aegon I's older son, [[Aenys I Targaryen|Aenys I]], a weakling who did not easily hold onto the throne. He died of stress at the outbreak of the [[Faith Militant uprising]], at which his younger brother [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] usurped the throne ahead of Aenys's own children. Maegor killed Aenys's eldest son [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon]] in battle, then forced his sister-wife [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena]] (Maegor's own half-niece) to marry him. When Maegor's mother Visenya died in 44 AC it caused enough of a distraction for Aenys's wife Alyssa Velaryon to flee their captivity on Dragonstone along with Jaehaerys and Alysanne. Aenys's second son Viserys was then tortured to death by Maegor at King's Landing in retaliation. Jaehaerys was left as Aenys's heir, and rebel lords across the realm increasingly switched loyalty to him. In the end there was no great new civil war as all of Maegor's allies totally abandoned him, and he opened his wrists on the Iron Throne rather than be taken alive.\n\nJaehaerys, who knew well how the Faith regarded incestuous marriage,\u00a0took precautions to assure that his marriage would be accepted by his subjects - not by force (as his weak father and evil uncle acted), but willingly. For that purpose, he\u00a0sent out three men and four women - known as the \"Seven Speakers\" (among them\u00a0was one of Maegor's wives,\u00a0[[Elinor Costayne]])\u00a0-\u00a0throughout the realm to tell\u00a0anyone they met about\u00a0Alysanne's kindness,\u00a0piety, and generosity,\u00a0her sweet and gentle nature, and her love for her husband and\u00a0all the people of the\u00a0kingdom, great and small. Whenever someone challenged the Seven Speakers\u00a0by citing passages from [[The Seven-Pointed Star]], they had a ready answer, known as the\u00a0Doctrine of Exceptionalism:\u00a0the Targaryens were different,\u00a0their roots were not in Andalos, but in Valyria of old, where different laws and traditions held sway, therefore the\u00a0laws of the Seven\u00a0did not apply to them.\u00a0The\u00a0Seven Speakers successfully performed their assignment, and no one rose against the\u00a0King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne.\n\nThe subsequent reign of Jaehaerys I and Alysanne lasted over 50 years and was a golden age of peace and prosperity across all of Westeros. Alysanne is popularly remembered as \"Good Queen Alysanne\". Among her many acts governing the kingdoms, she convinced Jaehaerys to enact several new [[Rape|domestic violence and rape laws]], among them the \"First Night\" right; by that,\u00a0Alysanne earned the love of the smallfolk. A dragon rider like her husband, Alysanne once flew to [[Winterfell]] on a royal visit - her on [[Silverwing]], Jaehaerys I on [[Vermithor]], along with four other dragons. On a whim she flew ahead to the [[Wall]]; recognizing the poor state of repair that the [[Night's Watch]] had dwindled to, she became a great patron of the order, paying with her own jewelry. She also pesuaded her husband to extend the [[Gift]].\n\nJaehaerys and Alysanne ruled wisely and well for over fifty years. Jaehaerys lived so long that he actually outlived Alysanne as well as most of his children (many of whom died untimely deaths), and was thus succeeded by his grandson Viserys I - the only time in history that a king was succeeded by his grandson. Alysanne predeceased Jaehaerys by about three years, and her loss broke the old king for the few remaining years of his life, leaving him bedridden until his death.\n\nIn terms of Alysanne's personality and temperament, Alysanne was the very model of a dignified, wise, yet powerful monarch (much like her brother-husband). George R.R. Martin described her appearance (for licensed artwork) as similar to Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of Eleanor of Aquitaine in the 1968 film adaptation of ''The Lion in Winter''.\n\n===Children===\nJaehaerys and Alysanne had thirteen children together. In order of birth, their names were Aegon, Alyssa, Aemon, Baelon, Daella, Aeryn, Vaegon, Maegelle, Valerion, Viserra, Gaemon, Saera, and Gael - but of these thirteen only nine would live to adulthood: Aegon, Aeryn, Valerion, and Gaemon all died young. Apparently, only four of them had children in turn (and two of them, Baelon and Alyssa, were married to each other).\u00a0According to\u00a0''Fire & Blood'', however, the second child was called Daenerys (the first Targaryen who was named Daenerys, preceding [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|the daughter of Aegon IV]]\u00a0and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys Stormborn]]), and there was no\u00a0Aeryn.\n\nAemon married outside of the family, to Jocelyn Baratheon, and had a daughter whom he named [[Rhaenys Velaryon|Rhaenys]], after his father's grandmother. Aemon died in 92 AC fighting against Myrish pirates who had seized the eastern side of [[Tarth]]. Jaehaerys ultimately chose Baelon over Rhaenys as his heir - despite the fact that an older daughter normally succeeded ahead of a younger uncle according to the normal inheritance laws in Westeros. The exact circumstances that led to such a decision are unclear but it briefly caused a major rift between Jaehaerys and Alysanne.\n\nBaelon himself had two surviving children with his sister Alyssa, sons [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]]. Baelon was also named [[Hand of the King]], but later died of a burst belly in 101 AC, two years before Jaehaerys I died, leading to a Great Council to determine who the heir should be. Rhaenys again put forward her claim, along with those of her children\u00a0Laenor and Laena Velaryon, but she was again rejected in favor of Jaehaerys's grandson Viserys I Targaryen. Daella\u00a0married Lord Rodrik [[House Arryn|Arryn]]\u00a0and died giving birth to a daughter, [[Aemma\u00a0Arryn|Aemma&nbsp;Arryn]], who was the first wife of Viserys I and the mother of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]].\n\nVaegon was given to the [[Citadel]] at a young age and later became an [[archmaester]], holding a ring, rod, and mask of yellow gold suggesting that he mastered economics. Maegelle joined the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]] and became a [[septa]]. Well known for her compassion, she nursed children afflicted with [[greyscale]], but she eventually became afflicted herself and died. Viserra was a high-spirited girl who as betrothed to Lord [[House Manderly|Manderly]] of [[White Harbor]], but she died in a mishap when she fell off her horse while racing drunkenly through the streets of King's Landing. Saera was given to the Faith, but she had other wishes and left across the [[Narrow Sea]] and did not return from the East, greatly saddening Jaehaerys I in his old age. She later became the owner of a famous [[pleasure house]] in [[Volantis]]. Gael was a simple-minded but sweet girl who was Queen Alysanne's favorite. It was said that she died of a summer fever but the truth was that she drowned herself in the [[Blackwater Bay|Blackwater]]. The reason was that she had been seduced and abandoned by a traveling singer who left her pregnant. In her grief, Alysanne would die a year later - leaving the elderly Jaehaerys an empty shell of himself for the last three years of his life.\n\nThe practical result of all this is that despite Alysanne giving birth to thirteen children by Jaehaerys, they only had three grandchildren who survived to adulthood and had children of their own: Rhaenys, Viserys I, and Daemon.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Targaryen navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Alysanne}}\n<!--InterWiki Links-->\n[[de:Alysanne Targaryen]]\n[[fr:Alysanne Targaryen]]\n[[pl:Alysanne Targaryen]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Valyrians]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Dragonriders]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

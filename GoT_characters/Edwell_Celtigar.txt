One day, the Faith Militant emerged from the shadows, and the lords sent to quash it joined it instead. His Hand resigned and retired to his island home.|[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel}}\nLord '''Edwell Celtigar''' was the [[Lordship|Lord]] of [[Claw Isle]] and [[Hand of the King]] to [[Maegor Targaryen]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[Maegor Targaryen]] fought to wipe out the [[Faith Militant uprising]], though the cruelty and fear he inspired only inspired more people to rise up against him, with even the lords that he sent to combat the [[Faith Militant]] joining forces with them. It was due to this that Edwell resigned and returned home to [[Claw Isle]].<ref>\"[[Maegor the Cruel]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Edwell was named [[Hand of the King]] by King [[Maegor Targaryen]] in 44 AC, following the execution of the previous Hand, Lord [[Lucas Harroway]]. Maegor left Edwell to rule [[King's Landing]] alongside his wife, Queen [[Tyanna of the Tower]], when the king went to combat the [[Faith Militant uprising]] in 45 AC.\n\nIn 47 AC, Maegor had no heir and Edwell suggested that he take another wife to increase his chances of producing one. Edwell suggested his own maiden daughters Prunella and Prudence, who were twelve and thirteen at the time. Maegor did take another, but did not select either of Edwell's daughters. He resigned as Hand and returned in [[Claw Isle]] in 48 AC when even previously loyal lords began to turn against Maegor.\n\nKing [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] later ascended to the [[Iron Throne]] and Edwell was pardoned and named lord treasurer and [[Master of Coin]] by Lord Rogar Baratheon, the new Hand of the King. The wars that Maegor had fought had almost bankrupted the crown and Edwell enforced taxes upon the [[smallfolk]] such as tripling the port fees in King's Landing, [[Lannisport]] and [[Oldtown]]. He placed upon the smallfolk for fear of offending the high lords. The taxes made Elwell a hated figure among the smallfolk and resulted in a decline in business, with some ignoring his demands that the fees be raised.\n\nElwell was dismissed by King Jaeharys when he returned to King's Landing for his sixteenth [[nameday]], thanking him for his services. Three days later, Jaeharys undid most of the taxes that Elwell had introduced, which was very popular among the smallfolk.\n\nA disease known as the Shivers afflicted [[Westeros]] in the winter of 59 AC. Lord Elwell was one of the first high lords to die once it reached the [[Crownlands]].\n\nIn 130 AC, during the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Elwell's descendant Lord Bartimos Celtigar was Master of Coin to Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and reinstated the unpopular taxes that Elwell has once imposed.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Celtigar, Edwell}}\n[[Category:House Celtigar]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0434\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0440]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

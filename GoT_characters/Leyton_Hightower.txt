His flagship is called the ''Honor of Oldtown''. He has been [[Marriage|married]] four times and is currently married to Rhea [[House Florent|Florent]]. Among his children are [[Alerie Tyrell|Alerie]], wife of [[Lord of Highgarden|Lord]] [[Mace Tyrell]], and [[Lynesse Hightower|Lynesse]], former wife of [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Jorah Mormont]].\n\nDuring a [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Storm's End]], he was unhorsed by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. [[Lord of Casterly Rock|Lord]] [[Tywin Lannister]] once offered his [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] son, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], for marriage to one of his daughters, but Lord Leyton felt insulted and rejected the offer.\n\nDuring the beginning of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Lord Leyton supports [[Renly Baratheon]], but changes sides along with his [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] overlords to support [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. After the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], the [[small council]] rewards him with lesser tracts of lands taken from the defeated. After [[Euron Greyjoy]] captures the [[Shield Islands]], [[Willas Tyrell]] sends word from [[Highgarden]] so Leyton can prepare the defenses of [[Oldtown]]. Leyton remains in the Hightower, supposedly reading [[magic]]al texts with his eldest daughter, Malora, while his sons rule in his stead.\n\nWhile the [[Redwyne fleet]] sails back from [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] to the [[Arbor]] to fight the [[ironborn]], Lord Leyton sends Oldtown's fleet south of out of Whispering Sound, under the command of his sons, to attack the ironborn fleet in the rear. Euron and his subordinates are aware that soon they will be caught between the two enemy fleets, but they seem unconcerned.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hightower, Leyton}}\n[[ru:\u041b\u0435\u0439\u0442\u043e\u043d \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hightower]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Hightower]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

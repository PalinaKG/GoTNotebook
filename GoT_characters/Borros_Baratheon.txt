After the coronation of [[Aegon II Targaryen]], his mother, [[Alicent Hightower]] sent her second son [[Aemond Targaryen]] to rally support of their faction, the Greens, in order to gain the allegiance of lords that hadn't already declared for Aegon. [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], the leader of the Blacks, also sent her second son [[Lucerys Velaryon]] to try and gain Borros' allegiance. Aemond arrived at [[Storm's End]] first on his [[dragon]], [[Vhagar]], and pleaded his brother's case. By the time, Lucerys had arrive on his dragon, [[Arrax]], Aemond was still there. He pleaded his mother's case. However, Borros had already made his decision, and sent Lucerys away, signifying his allegiance to the Greens. Aemond's artificial sapphire eye cleared at Lucerys, causing him to flee Storm's End and Borros. Aemond would kill Lucerys moments later above [[Shipbreaker Bay]].<ref>\"[[The Dance of Dragons (Histories & Lore)|The Dance of Dragons]]\"</ref>\n}}\n\n== In the books ==\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n|Spoiler=\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Borros Baratheon was [[Marriage|married]] to Lady Elenda Caron, with whom he had five children - daughters Cassandra, Maris, Ellyn, and Floris and son Olyver. He was a bearded seasoned warrior who was more temperamental and belligerent than his stoic father, Lord Boremund Baratheon. He was illiterate. He was in conflict with [[Dornishmen]] on many occasions.\n\nThe [[Dance of the Dragons]] began and Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] flew to [[Storm's End]] on [[Vhagar]], hoping to wed one of Borros' daughters and gain the support of [[House Baratheon]] for the [[Greens]]. Shortly afterwards, [[Lucerys Velaryon]] arrived to convince Borros to fight for the [[Blacks]]. Borros refused Lucerys since he could not wed one his daughters due to his betrothal to his cousin Rhaena. Borros forbade Lucerys and Aemond from fighting under his roof, but allowed Aemond to pursue Lucery outside the keep, knowing the Lucerys and his [[dragon]] [[Arrax]] would be no match for Aemond and [[Vhagar]].\n\nBorros gathered an army of six thousand men at Storm's End and despite having declared for the [[Greens]] he went into the [[Red Mountains]] to pursue a [[Vulture King]] instead of fighting Rhaenyra's forces. King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]'s daughter [[Jaehaera Targaryen]] was sent to Storm's End with the protection of Ser Willis Fell of the [[Kingsguard]] after the [[Fall of King's Landing]].\n\nOnce Rhaenyra was killed in the [[Ambush at Dragonstone]], Borros left his pregnant wife at Storm's End and marched with six hundred [[Knighthood|knights]] and four hundred foot soldiers to King's Landing, seizing the city and ending the Moon of the Three Kings, a month-long period in which there were multiple \"monarchs\" in the capital. Borros agreed to have his elder daughter Cassandra marry the widowed King Aegon II and a younger daugher Floris marry Lord Larys Strong. It was said that the [[Shepherd]] cursed Borros before he was captured. Aegon sent Borros to subdue the [[Westerlands]], successfully bringing [[Rosby]], [[Castle Stokeworth]] and [[Duskendale]] to submission. The king demanded heavy ransoms, which angered the former Blacks.\n\nBorros rode up the [[Kingsroad]] to tackle a host of [[rivermen]]. He led the charge in the Battle of the Kingsroad, but the battle turned against the stormlanders and he retreated. He was betrayed by the crownlanders and is said to have been killed by twelve [[Knighthood|knights]]. His son Olyver was born just seven days after his death.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Baratheon navbox}}\n}}\n[[de:Borros Baratheon]]\n[[es:Borros Baratheon]]\n[[it:Borros Baratheon]]\n[[nl:Borros Baratheon]]\n[[zh:\u535a\u6d1b\u65af\u00b7\u62dc\u62c9\u5e2d\u6069]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baratheon, Borros}}\n[[Category:Lords Paramount]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Lords of Storm's End]]\n[[Category:Greens]]\n[[Category:Stormlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Baratheon]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

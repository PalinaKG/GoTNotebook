In the woods near [[Winterfell]] they stumble across [[Bran Stark]] and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], for a reward, but decide against it. [[Robb Stark]] intervenes, and kills Wallen and disables Osha. Stiv holds a knife to Bran's throat, and despite Bran's protests not to, Robb lowers his sword as Stiv tells him to. However, [[Theon Greyjoy]] shoots him through the back with an arrow, killing him. Osha surrenders to [[House Stark|Stark]] custody.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|6=yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nStiv and Osha.jpg|Stiv with [[Osha]] in the Wolfswood in \"[[A Golden Crown]]\".\nBranhostage.png|Stiv holding a knife to Bran's throat.\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Stiv is a member of a band of wildlings who manage to evade the Watch to seek succour in the lands to the south.

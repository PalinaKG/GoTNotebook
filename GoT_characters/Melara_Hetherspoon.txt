She watches as Cersei pricks her finger to draw a drop of blood for Maggy to taste and read Cersei's future. Once Maggy finishes her prediction, a terrified Melara tells Cersei they have to\u00a0leave.<ref>\"[[The Wars to Come]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Melara Hetherspoon is a daughter of Ser Tybolt Hetherspoon, the head of House Hetherspoon, and a childhood friend of Cersei Lannister. She's described as pretty but freckled, and \"healthy as a horse\". Unlike her portrayal in the series, Melara is described as bold, whereas the reluctant companion of Cersei and Melara is Jeyne Farman, who flees Maggy's tent the minute the woman opens her eyes.\n\nLike Cersei, Melara also asks about her future, asking if she will someday marry [[Jaime Lannister]]. The question angers Cersei, who thinks that Melara is \"a greedy little schemer with ideas above her station\", and that Jaime is not even aware that she exists. Maggy answers \"''Not Jaime, nor any other man. Worms will have your maidenhead. Your death is here tonight, little one. Can you smell her breath? She is very close''\". Hearing that, Cersei throws a jar of some thick potion into the old woman\u2019s eyes, and the girls flee.\n\nMelara begs Cersei never to speak of the things they heard that night, promising that\u00a0if they never talk about it, they\u2019ll soon forget, and then it will be just a bad dream they had.\u00a0\n\nMelara dies soon afterwards, by drowning in a well. It is heavily implied that Cersei pushed her into the well out of jealousy, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nIn the fifth novel, while Cersei performs her [[walk of atonement]], she hallucinates that a young girl in the crowd staring at her with Melara\u2019s accusing eyes.\n\nIn the series, the flashback ends before the audience learns if Melara asks her future.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n*{{AWOIAF|Jeyne Farman}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Hetherspoon, Melara}}\n\n[[de:Melara Heidewies]]\n[[es:Melara Hetherspoon]]\n[[fr:Melara Cuill\u00eatre]]\n[[it:Melara Hetherspoon]]\n[[nl:Melara Heyspaan]]\n[[zh:\u6885\u62c9\u96c5\u00b7\u8d6b\u65af\u73ed]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0425\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0443\u043d]]\n[[Category:Nobility|Hetherspoon, Melara]]\n[[Category:House Hetherspoon]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

He's the first to offer himself as the champion for Lady Lysa Arryn, followed by [[Eon Hunter]] and other men. However, Lady Lysa chooses Ser [[Vardis Egen]] as her champion.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|6=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, a member of House Lynderly of Snakewood is the first to offer himself as Lysa Tully's champion; Tyrion, however, doesn't recognize the Lynderly's identity, thus it is unclear whether he is Jon Lynderly.\n\nLater books identify two other members of House Lynderly: Lord Jon Lynderly and his son, Terrance, a boy who is later taken on as a squire for Robert Arryn by [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] (who is serving as Lord Protector of the Vale). Littlefinger assures Sansa that Jon Lynderly is one of his friends.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n[[de:Jon Leiherlich]]\n[[fr:Jon Lynderly]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u044b\u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lynderly, Jon}}\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:House Lynderly]]\n[[Category:Valemen]]\n[[Category:Living individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

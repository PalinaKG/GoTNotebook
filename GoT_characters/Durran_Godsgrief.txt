Declaring war against them, Durran built new castles, each larger and more formidable than the previous one, though all were the destroyed by the divine storms. Finally, the seventh castle, which Durran built with the aid of either the [[Children of the Forest]] or a very young [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Bran the Builder]], withstood the rage of the gods and became known as [[Storm's End]], while Durran earned the nickname of \"Durran Godsgrief\" and ruled as the first [[Storm King]].<ref>\"[[The Age of Heroes]]\"</ref><ref>\"[[The Stormlands]]\"</ref>\n\nDurran's dynasty, [[House Durrandon]], perished with the death of [[Argilac Durrandon]].

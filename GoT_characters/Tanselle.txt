Duncan broke several of Aerion's teeth in the process.<ref>\"[[The Kingsguard]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 8|Season 8]]===\nDuncan's defense of Tanselle from Aerion is mentioned in the hedge knight's entry in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', which the new [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] flicks through.<ref>\"[[The Iron Throne]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nTanselle is not mentioned in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels. She appears in ''The Hedge Knight'', the first of the ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' novellas, in which she is the love interest of Ser [[Duncan the Tall]].\n\nTanselle was tall and slim, with small breasts. Her hair was black and her skin tone resembled the color of olives. Due to her height, she was nicknamed \"Tanselle Too-Tall\".\n\nTanselle was a puppeteer whom Dunk gained an instant attraction to upon meeting her at the [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Ashford]], at which he also befriended Egg, the boy who would grow up to become King [[Aegon V Targaryen]]. Dunk asked her to paint his shield after seeing her puppet show. While performing a skit in which the hero kills a [[dragon]], she was attacked and insulted and had one of her fingers broken by Prince [[Aerion Targaryen]], who took the dragon's death as a slight against [[House Targaryen]] and accused her of treason. Dunk came to her rescue, but was taken prisoner for striking one of the royal princes. Tanselle and her family left for [[Dorne]] as quickly as possible afterwards, but she left behind Dunk's painted shield.\n\nAt some point between the ending of ''The Hedge Knight'' and the start of ''The Sworn Sword'', Dunk and Egg reached [[Prince's Pass]] and later [[Vaith]] in Dorne. They did not find her, and Dunk gave up hope that they would. Her fate after this is unknown.\n\nTanselle would hence appear in any potential TV adaptation of ''The Hedge Knight''.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Dornishmen]]\n[[Category:Smallfolk]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

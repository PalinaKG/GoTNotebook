He watches as two warriors squabble over a dancer at the wedding.<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref>\n\nMago objects to Daenerys intervening and denying the [[Dothraki]] to take their share of the [[Lhazareen]] women as spoils of war. He refuses to recognize her authority as ''[[khaleesi]]'', calling her a foreign whore, and also defies Drogo. The Khal fights him, disdainfully disarming himself and deliberately accepting an ''[[arakh]]'' wound to show contempt for Mago's combat skills before slitting his throat with his own weapon and then pulling his tongue out through the neck wound.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\u00a0Drogo brandished the tongue for his court to see and casually tossed it on a pile of heads next to his seat.\u00a0\n\nShortly after Mago's death, the wound he gave Drogo begins to fester, eventually leading to Drogo's incapacitation and subsequent death.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|1=yes|8=yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mago is a member of Khal Drogo's ''[[khalasar]]'', serving under ''Ko'' [[Jhaqo]]. He complains to Drogo that Daenerys deprived him of his rape victim, a Lhazareen girl named Eroeh (who does not appear in the TV show) - but does not defy or fight with Drogo after the latter verbally denying him.\u00a0Drogo is not injured by Mago, but during a battle against the ''khalasar'' of ''Khal'' Ogo. \n[[File:Mago fights drogo.PNG|thumb|Mago clashes with Drogo]]\nFollowing Drogo's death, Mago becomes a bloodrider for Jhaqo, one of the several ''Kos'' that proclaim themselves ''Khals'', followed by a portion of Drogo's ''Khalasar''. He seizes Eroeh, rapes her and gives her to his new Khal. Jhaqo gives her to his other six bloodriders, who gang-rape her, and finally cut her throat. When Daenerys hears about this, she swears furiously that she will pay both Mago and Jhaqo back for what they did to Eroeh. So far she has not had a chance to fulfill her oath.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode \"The Pointy End\", George R.R. Martin comments on the \"butterfly effect\" created when a character is killed off in the TV series, given that Mago continues to appear in the books.\n\nIn an interview dated July 12, 2011, Martin confirmed that Mago would be a recurring character in the sixth book.\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n* {{AWOIAF|Ogo}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[de:Mago]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0433\u043e]]\n[[zh:\u9a6c\u6208]]\n[[Category:Dothraki]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

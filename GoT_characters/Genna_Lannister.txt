Tywin, who was ten years old, spoke out against the match (the Freys were vassals of [[House Tully|another Great House]], thus the status of House Frey was far below House Lannister, and Emmon was not even Lord Frey's heir); his defiance unnerved both Tytos and Walder, though the betrothal remained standing. Genna did not approve of all Tywin did, nor enjoyed the company of the man he later became, yet she adored him for having been the only person to speak out against her betrothal.\n\nGenna once told Tywin that Tyrion, whom he strongly disliked and unjustly blamed for [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]]'s death, resembled him the most; Tywin grew so angry he refused to speak to Genna for six months.\n\nGenna was well-liked by her father and later by Tywin as well, until she for unknown reasons fell out of his favor, but retains a prominent position in Lannister family affairs, taking a prominent role during her nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s [[Second Siege of Riverrun|campaign in the Riverlands]], and a position on his war council.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Genna}}\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]]\n[[Category:Ladies]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

As a child, he was taken to [[King's Landing]] by his grandfather and showed him the [[last dragon]], who died later that same year.\n\nAs an adult, Arlan defeated Ser [[Damon Lannister]] in a [[tourney]] at [[Lannisport]]. In 193 AC, Arlan fought in a melee at King's Landing where he unhorsed the lord of [[House Stokeworth]] and the [[Bastard]] of [[Harrenhal]]. He was defeated by Prince [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor Targaryen]] in a tourney at [[Storm's End]] in 199 AC, with Arlan claiming to have broken seven lances against Baelor, with Baelor claiming that it was only four.\n\nArlan's nephew Roger served as his squire during the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], with the two fighting for Lord Hayford. They fought in the [[Battle of the Redgrass Field]], in which Roger and Arlan fought alongside Lord Hayford when he was killed by Lord Gormon Peake. Arlan later found [[Duncan the Tall|Dunk]] in the slums of [[Flea Bottom]] and took him as his squire. They served the lord of [[House Dondarrion]] in the conflict with the [[Vulture King]].\n\nArlan died of a chill as he and Dunk were traveling to a tourney at [[Ashford]], with Dunk inheriting his [[horse]]s Thunder, Chestnut and Sweetfoot.\n\nHis personal sigil was a silver winged chalice on a brown field.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[ru:\u0410\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u041f\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Rivermen]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

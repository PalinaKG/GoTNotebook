He takes part in the [[Great Ranging]] led by [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] and survives the [[Battle of the Fist of the First Men]], though he's injured.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\n[[File:Bannen's_Funeral_S3E4.jpg|thumb|Bannen is cremated at Craster's Keep.]]Bannen perishes while at [[Craster's Keep]] and a funeral is held by his sworn brothers. [[Grenn]] says he's surprised a broken foot could kill a man. [[Rast]], however, points out that [[Craster]] functionally starved him to death by giving them as little food as possible.<ref>\"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bannen is considered to be one of the best trackers in the Watch, and is one of the survivors of the battle at the [[Fist of the First Men]] who make it to Craster's Keep. He and eleven others are critically wounded. Sam and Giant try to treat him and the other injured men, but the medicine bags have been lost during the battle, thus all they can do is keep the wounded dry and warm and feed them. The ranger Kedge Whiteye has taken Bannen's mangled foot, but it is too little and too late. Bannen keeps saying, \"I'm cold. I'm so cold\". Sam tries to feed him onion broth, but he cannot swallow. Craster nastily comments, \"That one's dead. Be kinder to stick a knife in his chest than that spoon down his throat, you ask me\".\n\nAfter lying in agony at least nine days, Bannen dies of his injuries, much as he did in the TV series. In the book, it is Dirk who blames Craster for Bannen's death.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n\n[[de:Bannen]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Casualties of the conflict beyond the Wall]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

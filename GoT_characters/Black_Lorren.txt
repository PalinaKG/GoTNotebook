He is loyal to [[House Greyjoy]], the rulers of the [[Iron Islands]].\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 2|Season 2]]===\nWhen [[Theon Greyjoy]] tries to take command of his crew and his ship, the ''[[Sea Bitch]]'', Lorren mocks Theon by saying he doesn't need Theon to tell him how things are done, and that he could take on the job as the captain for himself.<ref>\"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]\"</ref>\n\nLorren is among Theon's\u00a0ironborn who [[Fall of Winterfell|seize Winterfell]]. He captures\u00a0Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] and brings\u00a0him before Theon, who brutally executes the defiant Rodrik.<ref>\"[[The Old Gods and the New]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Theon beats Lorren.jpg|thumb|Theon takes out his anger on Lorren.]]\nWhen [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]] later escape with [[Osha]] and [[Hodor]], Theon initially blames Lorren, who counters that Theon let his guard down with Osha by having sex and sleeping with her the night before. Theon angrily beats up Lorren in front of the rest of the ironborn for his comments.<ref>\"[[A Man Without Honor]]\"</ref>\n\nLorren is present for Theon's speech when [[Northmen]] lay siege of Winterfell. Aware of the terms offered to the invaders, he doesn't share the enthusiasm shared by the rest of his comrades. After Theon is knocked out by [[Dagmer]], he admits he couldn't wait for Theon to shut up.<ref>\"[[Valar Morghulis]]\"</ref>\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 3|Season 3]]===\n[[Balon Greyjoy]] receives a letter from [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] demanding that he withdraw all Ironborn from the North, which also reveals that Lorren and the other ironborn at Winterfell were flayed alive by Ramsay and the [[House Bolton]] soldiers despite [[Robb Stark]]'s promise of mercy.<ref>\"[[Mhysa]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 2 appearances|||||yes|yes|yes|||yes}}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Black Lorren is regarded as one of the most dangerous and formidable ironborn raiders, second only to Andrik the Unsmiling. He's described as a squat, thick man with a long black beard.\u00a0\n\nLorren is among the ironborn who raid the\u00a0[[Stony Shore]]\u00a0and destroy Benfred Tallhart's force. He also takes\u00a0part in\u00a0the capture of\u00a0Winterfell.\n\nWhen Theon goes to search for the Stark boys, he gives Lorren command over Winterfell and its residents as [[castellan]].\n\nAs Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join his sister's troops at Deepwood Motte or stay and fight with him against the Northmen who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Lorren is one of\u00a0the seventeen ironborn (alongside [[Wex]] and [[Harrag#In the books|Harrag]]) who choose to stay with Theon.\n\nWhile Ser Rodrik is besieging Winterfell, Lorren urges Theon to kill all the hostages and fight to the bitter end, but Theon prefers instead to parley with the besiegers. Although Lorren does not actually defy Theon like in the show, he grows to despise him for his behavior, as it is considered weakness and cowardice in the eyes of ironborn.\n\nWhen Ramsay and his men turn on Theon,\u00a0[[Sack of Winterfell|sack Winterfell]] and kill the ironborn, Lorren fights bravely; it takes four men to kill him. His body is found surrounded by several dead Dreadfort soldiers, indicating that he has taken some of his killers with him.\u00a0\n\n==See also==\n* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Greyjoy navbox}}\n[[de:Lorren]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d]]\n[[fr:Lorren]]\n[[Category:Ironborn]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

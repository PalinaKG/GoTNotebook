At some point, he was named [[Hand of the King]] to Maegor.\n\nIn 44 AC, Alys had a deformed stillborn baby. Maegor's third wife, Queen [[Tyanna of the Tower]], convinced him that the boy had not been of his seed, but the result of one of Alys's many affairs, and that Lucas himself had helped his daughter conceive a son for the king by sending men of proven fertility to her chambers. King Maegor believed Tyanna and executed her and Lucas, then marched on [[Harrenhal]] and wiped out everyone with a drop of [[House Harroway|Harroway]] blood.<ref>\"[[Maegor the Cruel]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Lucas Harroway's story is the same.

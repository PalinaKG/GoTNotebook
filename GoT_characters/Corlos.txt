He killed both the lion and its mate, but spared the cubs. This pleased the [[Old Gods]], and they sent a beam of sunlight deep into the cave, turning the stone walls to gold. He began mining the gold, and built a fort at the top of the mountain at which the gold mine was buried under. This fort would become a castle, and it would be known as [[Casterly Rock]] - named in honor of the huntsman's new [[Noble House|House]], [[House Casterly]]. With his new wealth and power, he ruled the Westerlands from his new home, and so did his descendants for hundreds of years until the castle was swindled from them by [[Lann]] the Clever.<ref>\"[[Casterly Rock (Histories & Lore)|Casterly Rock]]\"</ref>\n\n== In the books ==\nIn ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Corlos's story is the same.

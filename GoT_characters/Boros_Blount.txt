In the TV series he is merely a background character, and many of his lines and actions are given to his fellow Kingsguard Ser [[Meryn Trant]]. Blount is a member of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. He is a short-tempered, ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. He has a flat nose, jowls and grey hair. [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] considers him an angry paper shield. Many characters throughout the series think of Blount with contempt due to the man's cowardice. Like Trant, Varys considers him one of \"Cersei's creatures\". Sansa thinks that Blount is \"the worst of the Kingsguard, an ugly man with a foul temper, all scowls and jowls\", which is quite an accurate description of him.\n\nBoros, along with the other five Kingsguard members present, openly laughs when his Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]] is unlawfully dismissed from service.\n\nIn the books, it is Boros Blount who carries out Joffrey's orders to undress and beat [[Sansa Stark]] instead of Ser Meryn. He's also absent during the battle of the Blackwater, having been dismissed by Cersei for cowardice (he yielded [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] to Tyrion's agents when he was smuggled out of King's Landing, to protect his life from the impending attack). However, he is reinstated to the Kingsguard by [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] upon his return as Hand of the King, to fill the vacancy left by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] when he deserted. Jaime thinks that his sister should have never dismissed Boros, but their father only compounded the shame by reinstating him.\n\nFollowing Joffrey's death by poisoning, Jaime makes Boros the official food taster for King Tommen, as he deems him unfit to do anything else. Boros considers this a shameful post for a knight of the Kingsguard, grabs the hilt of his sword and says angrily \"You should be the food taster, it seems to me. What else is a cripple good for?\" Jaime smiles and challenges Boros to fight him, although he is aware that even fat, aging, and ordinary swordsman like Boros can hack him into bloody pieces. Luckily for Jaime, Boros is too cowardly to accept the challenge. He spits at Jaime's feet and storms outside, but complies in this new role.\n\nIn the [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial of Tyrion Lannister]], Boros testifies after Meryn Trant, repeating what Meryn said. Whatever dislike Boros harbors toward Cersei for dismissing him from the Kingsguard, he says the words she wants all the same.\n\nWatching how Boros tastes every dish set before Tommen, Kevan muses that it is a humiliating duty for a member of the Kingsguard; still, it is probably the only thing Boros is good for.\n\nSimilarly to at least three other members of the Kingsguard (Jaime, [[Preston Greenfield]] and [[Arys Oakheart]]), Boros violates his vow of celibaty; he is known to visit often at the [[Street of Silk]].\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n*{{AWOIAF|Meryn Trant}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Kingsguard navbox}}\n{{King's Landing Baratheon navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blount, Boros}}\n\n[[ru:\u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0442]]\n[[Category:Kingsguard]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Crownlanders]]\n[[Category:Members of House Blount]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

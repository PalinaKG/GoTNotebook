He is the father of [[Alicent Hightower]].<ref>[https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon ''House of the Dragon'': The ''Game of Thrones'' prequel | hbo.com]</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{HotD/House Hightower family tree}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOn February 11, 2021, HBO announced that [[Rhys Ifans]] had signed on for ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' in the role of Otto Hightower. The character breakdown reads as follows:\n{{Quote|[T]he Hand of the King, who loyally and faithfully serves both his king and his realm. As the Hand sees it, the greatest threat to the realm is the king's brother, Daemon, and his position as heir to the throne.|HBO|https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon }}\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Otto was famous for his knowledge. For this ability, he was named [[Hand of the King]]. He is now a warning to future Hands that knowledge is not everything. He served as Hand of the King under [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]], [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] and [[Aegon II Targaryen]], but was not Hand continuously.\n\nOtto first served as Hand after the death of Jaehaerys's Hand and son, Prince Baelon Targaryen. Jaehaerys was devastated by the death of his son and loss of his [[Alysanne Targaryen|beloved wife]] earlier, becoming grief-stricken, and with his health failing he became bedridden. Otto effectively ruled the kingdom as Hand in the final two years of Jaehaerys's reign while his daughter Alicent Hightower nursed the ailing king.\n\nOtto continued as Hand to Jaehaerys's successor, Viserys I Targaryen. He was father to Viserys's second wife, Queen [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]. In 109 AC, Otto was removed as Hand for hounding Viserys to declare Alicent's sons the heirs to the [[Iron Throne]] instead of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. Having no place at court anymore, Ser Otto returned to Oldtown. A \"queen's party\", known as the greens, a group of powerful lords who were friends with Queen Alicent, remained, who supported the rights of Alicent's sons.\n\nOtto wasn't the head of House Hightower, but the younger brother of the unnamed head of the family - by the time of the Dance, Otto's nephew Ormund was the ruler of House Hightower and [[Oldtown]]. Otto's wife is never mentioned in the books, and her absence from several major scenes at court seems to imply that she died years before the Dance of the Dragons. Otto had multiple children, but the only ones identified were Alicent and her \"youngest brother\" Gwayne.\n\n{{HotDSpoilerSection\n| Spoiler =\n\nIn 120 AC, Otto returned as Hand after Lord Lyonel Strong died. When Viserys died in 129 AC, Otto played a crucial role in crowning his eldest grandson as King Aegon II in defiance of the last will of Viserys I, which specified Rhaenyra as the successor. This defiance precipitated the civil war known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]].\n\n===The Dance of the Dragons===\nThe opposing faction, the [[Blacks]], included the battle-tested Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]], who, in the course of his pre-war adventures, had made many foes. Ser Otto had been amongst the first of these. He reached out to other enemies of the prince, the Kingdom of the Three Daughters, as allies. They were crucial in breaking the Velaryon blockade in the [[Battle of the Gullet]].\n\n[[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], however, perceived Otto's diplomacy as slothful at a time when Prince Daemon had captured [[Harrenhal]] and many houses had declared for the Blacks. This led to his replacement as Hand by Ser [[Criston Cole]], the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], despite the pleading of Ser Otto's daughter (and Aegon's mother), Queen Alicent Hightower. It was only after his dismissal that his efforts bore fruit.\n\nOtto was the first to be executed as a traitor by Rhaenyra Targaryen when she [[Fall of King's Landing|took]] [[King's Landing]] in 130 AC, just as he had predicted.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HotD/Hightower navbox}}\n{{HotD/SmallCouncil navbox}}\n[[de:Otto Hohenturm]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0442\u0442\u043e \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0443\u044d\u0440]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hightower, Otto}}\n[[Category:Hand of the King]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Reachmen]]\n[[Category:HotD/Living individuals]]\n[[Category:Members of House Hightower]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

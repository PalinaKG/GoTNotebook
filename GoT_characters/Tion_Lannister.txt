He was the [[squire]] for Prince [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] (who later became King Aegon V) during the Peake Uprising in 233 AC and became the heir to [[Casterly Rock]] when his brother [[Tywald Lannister|Tywald]] was killed in that conflict.\n\nTion was betrothed to a daughter of [[House Rowan]], though following Tywald's death he was seduced by his late brother's betrothed, Lady [[Ellyn Reyne]]. She convinced him to marry her instead, and though Lord Gerold opposed the match, he allowed the betrothal to take place since Tywald had asked Tion to \"take care of Lady Ellyn\" with his dying words. They married at Casterly Rock in 235 AC, with his younger brother [[Tytos Lannister|Tytos]] marrying [[Jeyne Marbrand]] in the same ceremony.\n\nThe Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion began in 236 AC, and though it was short lived and casualties were small, Tion was among the dead. Following his death, Ellyn lost a significant amount of power and influence. In an attempt to maintain it, she falsely claimed to be pregnant with Tion's child, which was exposed as a lie as months passed and her body showed no signs of pregnancy.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lannister navbox}}\n[[fr:Tion Lannister]]\n[[de:Tion Lennister]]\n[[es:Tion Lannister]]\n[[nl:Tion Lannister]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0438\u043e\u043d \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n[[zh:\u63d0\u6069\u00b7\u5170\u5c3c\u65af\u7279]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Tion}}\n[[Category:Members of House Lannister]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Westermen]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

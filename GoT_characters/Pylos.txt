He is still very much alive, and at 25 years old, is unlikely to be considered an \"expert\" in any particular field. He has been training to succeed Maester [[Cressen]]. He is kind, friendly and trustworthy.\n\nPylos treats [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] while the latter is imprisoned at Dragonstone. He also treats Edric Storm, one of Robert's bastards (in the show he was replaced with [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]), with leeches; the blood-filled leeches are later used in [[Leech ritual|Melisandre's ritual against the three false kings]].\n\nPylos educates [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], her cousin Edric Storm, and Davos's fifth son Devan. He does not give any of them a slack: he chides Edric for boasting about [[Robert Baratheon|his father]]'s victories, by pointing out that Robert also suffered defeats, among them at [[Battle of Ashford|Ashford]].\n\nAfter Davos is raised to the position of Stannis's [[Hand of the King]], he consults with Pylos, fearing that he is not worthy for that office because he is not highborn, veteran knight or educated. Pylos encourages Davos by pointing out that highborn nobles, great knights and educated men were extremely poor Hands, while a simple blacksmith's son - septon [[Barth]] - was an excellent Hand, who gave the realm forty years of peace and plenty. He (in the show - Shireen) teaches Davos to read and write.\n\nDuring one lesson, Pylos shows Davos a letter, which happens to be the distress message from [[Castle Black]]. Davos, unlike the former Hand, understands the importance of the message and persuades Stannis to travel north and assist the [[Night's Watch]].\n\nPylos is one of the people whom Davos recruits, to help him save Edric Storm from being sacrificed. Davos admires Pylos's courage, because he knew well what would be his punishment for assisting Davos.\n\nLater, Stannis travels to the [[North]], leaving at Dragonstone a small garrison. Pylos also remains in Dragonstone.\n\nIn the fourth novel, [[Loras Tyrell]] [[Abandonment of Dragonstone#In the books|conquers Dragonstone]]. It is not mentioned what has become of Pylos and the rest of the occupants of the castle - whether they have been killed or captured alive. \n\nThere is no mention in the novels that Pylos has ever researched the greyscale, or any other disease.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[de:Pylos]]\n[[fr:Pylos]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441]]\n[[Category:Archmaesters]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

Each nearly destroyed us with their foolishness.|Ser [[Alliser Thorne]]|The Lord Commanders}}\n'''Marq Rankenfell''', known to history as \"'''Mad Marq Rankenfell''',\" was a [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]].\n\n==Biography==\nAt some point, Marq Rankenfell joined the [[Night's Watch]], eventually rising to become its [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]]. Although he is not specifically described as having been terrible as a leader, his nickname would suggest either that at some point he literally went insane or that his commands were deemed by the others of the Night's Watch as nonsensical. His name is listed along with other examples of implied poor quality among past Lord Commanders. His name is mentioned in succession with others, such as\u00a0[[Robin Hill]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Tristan Mudd]].<ref>\"[[The Lord Commanders]]\"</ref>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, his story is the same.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Watch navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rankenfell, Marq}}\n\n[[de:Marq Rankenfell]]\n[[es:Marq Rankenfell]]\n[[nl:Marq Ranzenfel]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0420\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0444\u0435\u043b\u043b]]\n[[zh:\u9a6c\u67ef\u00b7\u84dd\u80af\u83f2\u5c14]]\n[[Category:Lords Commander of the Night's Watch]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}

She serves at the [[sept]] in [[Winterfell]]. Her secondary duties involve tutoring [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]] in needlework, embroidery, singing, morals, and other ladylike duties.\n\n===[[Game of Thrones Season 1|Season 1]]===\n[[File:Mordane 1x01.png|thumb|Septa Mordane complimenting Sansa's needlework.]]\nSepta Mordane tutors Arya and Sansa in needlework. She compliments Sansa on the skill of her work, but doesn't remark on Arya's grudging efforts.<ref>\"[[Winter Is Coming]]\"</ref> Mordane accompanies Arya and Sansa to [[King's Landing]] and dines with them. She is present at the meal when Arya threatens to kill [[Joffrey Baratheon]] for his actions on the [[Kingsroad]] and reports this to her father. When Sansa is disdainful of the doll which [[Eddard Stark]] gives her and asks to be excused, it is to Septa Mordane that he says, \"War was easier than daughters.\"<ref>\"[[Lord Snow]]\"</ref> Mordane shows Sansa the throne room as part of Sansa's tutoring on the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Sansa is concerned over what will happen if she has no sons, only daughters, a concern that Mordane dismisses as highly unlikely.<ref>\"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]\"</ref>\n[[File:Mordane.png|thumb|Mordane faces the Lannister soldiers.]]\n\nMordane accompanies Arya and Sansa to the Hand's [[tournament]] and is present when Littlefinger explains the background of his nickname to Arya.<ref>\"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]\"</ref> Mordane chaperones Sansa when Joffrey meets her to apologize for his behavior on the Kingsroad.<ref>\"[[A Golden Crown]]\"</ref>\n\nShe appears to be less approving of Joffrey than she once was, but Sansa doesn't notice. Sansa is rude to Septa Mordane when she asked the septa of her origins (likely due to Cersei's example being a bad influence).\n\nAfter the failed attempt by Sansa's father to remove Joffrey from the [[Iron Throne]] following King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s death, Mordane hears combat in the courtyard at the [[Red Keep]]. Fearing the worst, she orders Sansa to run to her room and bar the door to anyone she does not know. After Sansa leaves, Mordane is confronted by several Lannister soldiers.<ref>\"[[The Pointy End]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Mordane's head!.jpg|thumb|Mordane's head on Traitors' Walk.]]\nAfter the North rises in rebellion, Joffrey takes Sansa to the Traitors' Walk and forces her to gaze at her heads of her father and household on spikes. He also reveals to Sansa's horror that he needlessly had Mordane beheaded, and her head placed on a spike next to that of her father.<ref>\"[[Fire and Blood]]\"</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes||yes||yes}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCripples-Bastards-and-Broken-Things-sansa-stark-23083167-1280-720.jpg|Mordane with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]] as they are approached by [[Petyr Baelish]] at the Tourney of the Hand.\nSansa.jpg|The spectators cheer for Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] at the Tourney of the Hand.\nLord Snow ned Septa Sansa.png|Sitting with Lord Stark and Sansa\n</gallery>\n\n==In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Septa Mordane is a loyal servant of [[House Stark]], despite the fact that most of the family worships the [[Old Gods of the Forest]] rather than the Seven. She finds Sansa to be a willing, able and promising student. She despairs at the tomboyish Arya, who'd rather be running around the castle and playing with swords. Arya hates to do needlework and when she runs off to watch sword practice, she returns to her room to find Septa Mordane and her mother waiting to have words with her. Despite this rebellion, she is fond and fiercely protective of both of her charges.\n\nShe travels to King's Landing with Eddard Stark and his daughters. Arya is angry when she hears Septa Mordane praising Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s needlework even though it's not much better than Arya's own, which is always found wanting.\n\nSepta Mordane goes to the Hand's tourney with Sansa and [[Jeyne Poole]] and must leave when Jeyne gets distraught witnessing the death of Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale, pierced in the neck by a splinter of a jousting lance directly in front of them. She leads Jeyne away. Later the Septa chaperones Sansa to the post tourney feast where Joffrey encourages them both to drink wine. When Sansa is ready to go she realizes that Septa Mordane is lying face down on the table asleep and accepts Joffrey's offer of an escort, but Joffrey then tells the Hound to do it and leaves them.\n\nSansa is not with Septa Mordane when the [[Massacre in the Red Keep|attack on Eddard Stark's people]] takes place in the book. Sansa went to Cersei to plead for her to talk to Eddard after he told Sansa that she and Arya were going to be taken out of the Keep by Stark men and taken to the docks to board a ship for Winterfell. Sansa is so distraught over leaving King's Landing and the breaking of her betrothal to Joffrey, she doesn't know she is betraying her father and putting them all in peril. Cersei promises to help, but then has Sansa escorted to a tower room and locked in under guard. Later Jeyne Poole is pushed into the room and they are both kept there for three days with no idea of what is occurring, other than the little that Jeyne saw of Stark men being killed.\n\nSansa is shown Septa Mordane's unrecognizable head on a spike by Joffrey, he takes her to see her father's head up on the walls, where Sansa asks why she was killed as she was god sworn. Joffrey then replies, claiming that she was executed because she was a traitor.\n\n==See also==\n*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Stark navbox}}\n\n[[de:Mordane]]\n[[fr:Mordane]]\n[[pl:Mordane]]\n[[pt-br:Mordane]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[Category:Septas]]\n[[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Westerosi]]"}}}]}},"categorymembers":[{"pageid":53087,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Red Keep"},{"pageid":41368,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at Winterfell"},{"pageid":53697,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination in the Great Hall"},{"pageid":41364,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Balon Greyjoy"},{"pageid":63112,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen"},{"pageid":36916,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Ethan Forrester"},{"pageid":26468,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Jon Arryn"},{"pageid":40892,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon"},{"pageid":59871,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Robert Baratheon"},{"pageid":58714,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination on the Sunset Sea"},{"pageid":46905,"ns":0,"title":"Assassinations at the Twins"},{"pageid":15259,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Astapor"},{"pageid":57752,"ns":0,"title":"Attempt of assassination on Aegon I"},{"pageid":47908,"ns":0,"title":"Attempted murder of Mira Forrester"},{"pageid":62466,"ns":0,"title":"Battle of King's Landing"},{"pageid":40883,"ns":0,"title":"Coup in Dorne"},{"pageid":46254,"ns":0,"title":"Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor"},{"pageid":20314,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in King's Landing"},{"pageid":33674,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre at Hardhome"},{"pageid":20580,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre in the Red Keep"},{"pageid":42540,"ns":0,"title":"Massacre of the khalar vezhven"},{"pageid":34704,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Castle Black"},{"pageid":15258,"ns":0,"title":"Mutiny at Craster's Keep"},{"pageid":22891,"ns":0,"title":"Purple Wedding"},{"pageid":13801,"ns":0,"title":"Red Wedding"},{"pageid":8012,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination of Renly Baratheon"},{"pageid":3424,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of King's Landing"},{"pageid":25479,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Mole's Town"},{"pageid":57972,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Qohor"},{"pageid":53654,"ns":0,"title":"Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel"},{"pageid":26365,"ns":0,"title":"Assassination at the Tower of the Hand"},{"pageid":10129,"ns":0,"title":"Sack of Winterfell"}]}}
